{PLAYER} received the prize\n{STR_VAR_1}.$
The Battle Swap rules are listed.$
Which heading do you want to read?$
In a Battle Swap event, you may use\nonly three POKéMON.\pWhether you are renting or swapping,\nyour team may not have two or more\lof the same POKéMON.$
You may swap POKéMON only with\nthe TRAINER you have just defeated.\pYou may swap for only those POKéMON\nused by the beaten TRAINER.$
After every battle you win, you may\nswap for one of your defeated\lopponent's POKéMON.\pYou will not be able to swap POKéMON\nwith the third TRAINER in the event.$
There are two key points to be aware\nof when swapping POKéMON.\pFirst, when swapping, you can't check\nthe stats of the POKéMON you are\labout to receive.\pSecond, the POKéMON on your team\nare lined up in sequence, depending on\lthe order in which you rented them.\pThis sequence remains unchanged\neven when swaps are made.$
The POKéMON of the SLATEPORT\nBATTLE TENT are all rentals.\pAll rental POKéMON are kept at\nLevel 30.$
The VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT\nrules are listed.$
Which heading do you want to read?$
Here at the VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT,\nPOKéMON are required to think and\lbattle by themselves.\pUnlike in the wild, POKéMON that live\nwith people behave differently\ldepending on their nature.$
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON\nmay prefer to attack no matter what.\pAnother POKéMON may prefer to protect\nitself from any harm.\pYet another may enjoy vexing or\nconfounding its foes.\pDepending on its nature, a POKéMON\nwill have favorite moves that it is good\lat using.\pIt may also dislike certain moves that\nit has trouble using.$
There are offensive moves that inflict\ndirect damage on the foe.\pThere are defensive moves that are\nused to prepare for enemy attacks or\lused to heal HP and so on.\pThere are also other somewhat-odd\nmoves that may enfeeble the foes with\lstat problems including poison and \lparalysis.\pPOKéMON will consider using moves in\nthese three categories.$
When not under command by its TRAINER,\na POKéMON may be unable to effectively\luse certain moves.\pA POKéMON is not good at using any\nmove that it dislikes.\pIf a POKéMON only knows moves that\ndo not match its nature, it will often\lbe unable to live up to its potential.$
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON may\nstart using moves that don't match its\lnature when it is in trouble.\pIf a POKéMON begins behaving oddly\nin a pinch, watch it carefully.$
At this BATTLE TENT, the levels of\nyour opponents will be adjusted to\lmatch the levels of your POKéMON.\pHowever, no TRAINER you face will\nhave any POKéMON below Level 30.$
The VERDANTURF BATTLE TENT\nrules are listed.$
What's up, youngster?\pWhat, it's you who's supposed to have\na tattered old map?\pLet's have a look.\n… … … … … …\pBoy, this is quite a ways away.\nI'm afraid I can't help you…$
BRINEY: Hold on a second!\pWhat's the idea of turning down\nsomeone that I owe so much to?$
{PLAYER}{KUN}, I'm terribly sorry.\pYou came to me seeking my help,\nand we almost turned you away.\pWell, let me make things right.\pWe'll sail right away, of course!\pLet's find this island on\nthis OLD SEA MAP!$
Is it you who brought that odd\nticket?\pWhere you're trying to go is an island\nthat's far, far away.\pNo one knows what awaits there…\pThe very thought excites my blood\nas a sailing man!\pGet on board, youngster!$
CAPT. BRINEY can be so maddeningly\nfickle…\pDo you want to return to LILYCOVE?$
What an oddly shaped island, eh?\nDo you want to return to LILYCOVE?$
Is it you who brought those\nodd tickets?\p… … …Hm.\pThese tickets will get you to islands\nthat are far, far away.\pNo one knows what awaits there,\nor what may happen there.\pThe very thought excites my blood\nas a sailing man!\pGet on board, youngster!\nWhere shall we sail first?$
Did… Did you hear that?\nThat low growling from deep in there.\pAre you sure it's safe?\nDo you think we should leave?$
The writing is fading as if it was\nwritten a long time ago…\p“…ber, 6th day\nIf any human…sets foot here…\lagain…et it be a kindhearted pers…\l…ith that hope, I depar…”$
Myuu…$
This move can be learned only\nonce. Is that okay?$
Heh! My POKéMON totally rules!\nIt's cooler than any POKéMON!\pI was lipping off with a swagger in\nmy step like that when the CHAIRMAN\lchewed me out.\pThat took the swagger out of my step.\pIf you'd like, I'll teach the move\nSWAGGER to a POKéMON of yours.$
What, no? Can't you get into\nthe spirit of things?$
All right, which POKéMON wants to\nlearn how to SWAGGER?$
I'll just praise my POKéMON from now\non without the swagger.$
Did you know that you can go from\nhere a long way in that direction\lwithout changing direction?\pI might even be able to roll\nthat way.\pDo you think your POKéMON will\nwant to roll, too?\pI can teach one the move ROLLOUT\nif you'd like.$
You don't need to be shy about it.\nLet's roll!$
Ehehe, sure thing! It'd be great if\nthe POKéMON looked like me.$
Rolling around in the grass makes me\nhappy. Come on, let's roll!$
There's a move that gets stronger\nwhen you keep using it in a row.\pIt's a BUG-type move, and it is\nwickedly cool.\pIt's called FURY CUTTER.\nWant me to teach it to a POKéMON?$
We're not on the same wavelength.$
Yay!\nShow me which POKéMON I should teach.$
I get a thrill watching to see if\nthe move keeps hitting in succession!$
Ah, young one!\pI am also a young one, but I mimic\nthe styles and speech of the elderly\lfolks of this town.\pWhat do you say, young one?\nWould you agree to it if I were to\loffer to teach the move MIMIC?$
Oh, boo! I wanted to teach MIMIC\nto your POKéMON!$
Fwofwo! And so I shall!\nLet me see the POKéMON\lyou wish me to teach.$
MIMIC is a move of great depth.\pCould you execute it to perfection\nas well as me…?$
I want all sorts of things!\nBut I used up my allowance…\pWouldn't it be nice if there were\na spell that made money appear when\lyou waggle a finger?\pIf you want, I can teach your POKéMON\nthe move METRONOME.\pMoney won't appear, but your POKéMON\nwill waggle a finger. Yes?$
Okay. I'll be here if you change\nyour mind.$
Okay! I'll teach it!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?$
When a POKéMON waggles its finger\nlike a METRONOME, all sorts of nice\lthings happen.\pWouldn't it be nice if we could\nuse it, too?$
Humph! My wife relies on HIDDEN\nPOWER to stay awake.\pShe should just take a nap like I do,\nand SLEEP TALK.\pI can teach your POKéMON how to\nSLEEP TALK instead. Interested?$
Oh, fine, fine. You want to stay awake\nwith HIDDEN POWER, too…$
Ah, an appreciative child!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?$
I've never once gotten my wife's\ncoin trick right.\pI would be happy if I got it right\neven as I SLEEP TALK…$
When I see the wide world from up\nhere on the roof…\pI think about how nice it would be\nif there were more than just one me\lso I could enjoy all sorts of lives.\pOf course it's not possible.\nGiggle…\pI know! Would you be interested in\nhaving a POKéMON learn SUBSTITUTE?$
Oh, no?\pA POKéMON can make a copy of\nitself using it, you know.$
Giggle…\nWhich POKéMON do you want me to\lteach SUBSTITUTE?$
We human beings should enjoy our\nown lives to the utmost!\pI hope you'll get that way, too!$
I can't do this anymore!\pIt's utterly hopeless!\pI'm a FIGHTING-type TRAINER,\nso I can't win at the MOSSDEEP GYM\lno matter how hard I try!\pArgh! Punch! Punch! Punch!\nPunch! Punch! Punch!\pWhat, don't look at me that way!\nI'm only hitting the ground!\pOr do you want me to teach your\nPOKéMON DYNAMICPUNCH?$
Darn! You're even making fun of me?\nPunch! Punch! Punch!$
What? You do? You're a good person!\nWhich POKéMON should I teach?$
I want you to win at the MOSSDEEP GYM\nusing that DYNAMICPUNCH!$
Sigh…\pSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER is really\nlovably admirable.\pBut that also means I have many\nrivals for his attention.\pHe's got appeal with a DOUBLE-EDGE.\nI couldn't even catch his eye.\pPlease, let me teach your POKéMON\nthe move DOUBLE-EDGE!$
Oh…\nEven you rejected me…$
Okay, which POKéMON should I teach\nDOUBLE-EDGE?$
I won't live for love anymore!\nI'll become tough!$
I don't intend to be going nowhere\nfast in the sticks like this forever.\pYou watch me, I'll get out to the city\nand become a huge hit.\pSeriously, I'm going to cause\na huge EXPLOSION of popularity!\pIf you overheard that, I'll happily\nteach EXPLOSION to your POKéMON!$
Gaah! You're turning me down because\nI live in the country?$
Fine! An EXPLOSION it is!\nWhich POKéMON wants to blow up?$
For a long time, I've taught POKéMON\nhow to use EXPLOSION, but I've yet\lto ignite my own EXPLOSION…\pMaybe it's because deep down,\nI would rather stay here…$
This is a test message.\nThis is a signpost.$
It's very disappointing…$
Okay, I understand…$
I'm terribly sorry…$
Thank you…$
Ahahaha! Aren't you embarrassed?\nEveryone's watching!$
Grr…\nWhat the…$
My DOME ACE title isn't just for show!$
Ahahaha!\nYou're inspiring!$
Way to work!\nThat was a good lesson, eh?$
Good job!\nYou know what you're doing!$
Hey, hey, hey!\nYou're finished already?$
What happened here?$
Humph…$
Urk…$
Hah!$
Darn!$
Oh, come on!\nYou have to try harder than that!$
No way!\nGood job!$
Heheh!\nWhat did you expect?$
Huh?\nAre you serious?!$
Your POKéMON are wimpy because\nyou're wimpy as a TRAINER!$
Ah…\nNow this is something else…$
Gwahahaha!\nMy brethren, we have nothing to fear!$
Gwah!\nHahahaha!$
Hey! What's wrong with you!\nLet's see some effort! Get up!$
That's it! You've done great!\nYou've worked hard for this!$
Hey! Don't you give up now!\nGet up! Don't lose faith in yourself!$
That's it! You've done it!\nYou kept working for this!$
I'm investigating this ship on behalf\nof CAPT. STERN.\pHe also asked me to find a SCANNER,\nbut I haven't had any success…$
Oh! That's a SCANNER!\pListen, can I get you to deliver that\nto CAPT. STERN?\pI want to investigate this ship a\nlittle more.$
This ship is called S.S. CACTUS.\nIt seems to be from an earlier era.$
What's so funny about having my inner\ntube aboard the ship?$
Whoa, you overwhelmed me!$
It's not easy throwing POKé BALLS\nwhile hanging on to an inner tube!$
Isn't it fun here?\nI get excited just being here!$
When we go out to sea, we SAILORS\nalways bring our POKéMON.\lHow about a quick battle?$
Whoops, I'm sunk!$
The ship's bottom has sunk into the\ndepths.\pIf a POKéMON knew how to go underwater,\nwe might make some progress…$
Yay!\nIt's a ship!$

DAN: While searching for treasures,\nwe discovered a TRAINER!$
DAN: We couldn't win even though\nwe worked together…$
DAN: We can't find any treasures…\nI wonder if someone got them already?$
DAN: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.$
KIRA: Oh?\nWe were searching for treasures.\lBut we discovered a TRAINER instead!$
KIRA: Ooh, so strong!$
KIRA: Where could the treasures be?\pI've already decided what I'm buying\nwhen we find the treasures!$
KIRA: Oh, you don't have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle some other time!$
KIRA: Oh, you make me so angry!\nI'm going to register you for that!$
DAN: We've been searching for\ntreasures all this time.\pOur POKéMON have grown stronger, too.\nLet us show you, okay?$
DAN: You're strong, as usual!$
DAN: We can't find any treasures,\nwe lose at POKéMON…\pI want to go home… But if I say that,\nshe gets all angry with me…$
DAN: You don't even have two POKéMON.\nYou can't expect to beat us like that.$
KIRA: Oh? We meet again!\pJust like us, you still haven't given up\nsearching for treasures, have you?\pWant to make it so the loser has\nto give up searching?$
KIRA: Oh, we lost again…$
KIRA: We're not leaving until we raise\nour POKéMON some more and we find\lthe treasures here!$
KIRA: Oh, you don't have two POKéMON?\nWe'll have to battle some other time!$
I'm not good at swimming,\nbut I am good at battles!$
Oops.\nThat didn't go very well.$
Walking around barefoot in this ship\nis kind of gross.$
Strength and compassion…\nThose are a TRAINER's treasures!$
Ah, there is something about you\nthat sparkles.$
In a cabin somewhere on board,\nI saw something sparkle.$
This is a perfect place to go exploring!\nIt's exciting here!\pI bet there're amazing treasures on\nboard.$
Ships of this sort are rare, so I'm\ntaking a look around.\pHmhm…\nThere appear to be other cabins…$
What on earth would compel you to\ncome here? You must be curious!$
Not just curious, but also strong…$
The man next door…\pHe says he's just sightseeing,\nbut I don't know about that.$
You're such a tough TRAINER!\nLet me register you as a memento!$
What on earth would compel you to\ncome back? You must really be curious!$
Aren't you too strong?$
I'm sure that man's up to something!\nHe just acts so suspiciously!$
Waaah!\nI've been found! …Huh?$
Oh, you're not my mom.$
I'm in trouble with my mom, so I ran.\nKeep it a secret where I am!$
Urrrrppp…\pI'm getting queasy just being aboard\nthis ship…\pIt's not even moving, but…$
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\pOur BOSS isn't here! He's gone off to\nsnatch something important!\p… …\nWhere did he go?\pWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?$
What? What?\nAre you a TEAM MAGMA grunt?\pI hear that TEAM MAGMA is trying to\nawaken an awesome POKéMON at their\lHIDEOUT.\pBut where might their HIDEOUT be?$
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\pOur BOSS isn't here!\nHe's gone off to jack a submarine!\p… …\nWhere did he go?\pWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?$
What? What? What do you want with \nTEAM AQUA?\pOur BOSS isn't here! He's on his way to\nMT. PYRE on ROUTE 122!\p… …\nWhy did he go?\pWahaha! Do you really think I'd tell\nyou something that crucial?$
What? What?\nAre you a TEAM MAGMA grunt?\pI hear that TEAM MAGMA is after\nan awesome POKéMON at MT. CHIMNEY.\pBut what is that POKéMON like?$

Ayiyiyi!\nSuspicious character spotted!$
Grrrrr…\nI lost it!$
I took the loss for the TEAM,\nbut I did my job…$
If you want to know the secret about\nour HIDEOUT, you have me to beat!$
I can't win at all…$
Our HIDEOUT's secret?\pWell, let's just say…\nThere's a submarine at the far end!\pBut, by now…\nKekekeke…$
Fuel supply loaded A-OK!\nIn-cruise snacks loaded A-OK!\pNothing left to do but KO a pesky\nmeddler!$
I took a serious licking!$
Humph!\nThis was supposed to happen!\pMy mission was to just hold you up!$
Yawn… Keeping watch over the\nHIDEOUT bores me. I'll take you on.$
Yawn…\nOh, I lost…$
If you scurry too much, other TEAM\nAQUA members might get you.$
Hey!\nYou there!\pWhich do you think is cooler?\nTEAM AQUA's uniform or TEAM MAGMA's?$
I lost in a cool way…$
If you have a cool uniform, you look\ngood even in a loss, don't you think?$
Hehehe…\pGot here already, did you?\nWe underestimated you!\pBut this is it!\pI'm a cut above the GRUNTS you've seen\nso far.\pI'm not stalling for time.\nI'm going to pulverize you!$
Hehehe…\nSo, I lost, too…$
Hehehe!\pWhile I was toying with you, our BOSS\ngot through his preparations!$
Hehehe!\pOur BOSS has already gone on his way to\nsome cave under the sea!\pIf you're going to give chase, you'd\nbetter search the big, wide sea beyond\lLILYCOVE.\pBut will you find it then?\nHehehe!$
Wahahah, I grew weary of waiting!\nYou owe me a battle, too!$
Tired of waiting…\nLost and dazed…$
BOSS…\nIs this good enough?$
Warp panels, the HIDEOUT's pride\nand joy!\pYou're clueless about where you are,\naren't you?\pFluster and tire out the enemy, then\nlower the boom! That's our plan!$
What's wrong with you?\nYou're not tired at all!$
That reminds me… I can't remember\nwhere I put the MASTER BALL.\pIf I fail to guard it, our BOSS will\nchew me out…$
When I joined TEAM AQUA, the first\nthing I had to learn was how these\lwarp panels connected.$
I was too occupied thinking about\nthe warp panels…$
I'll have to learn about how I can\nbattle more effectively…$

REFEREE: The ARENA TYCOON!\nMake way for GRETA!$
GRETA: Hey!\nHowdy!\p…Wait, are you the challenger?$
Is that right? Hmm…\nHmhm…$
I don't know how to say it, but…\nTo put it bluntly, you look pretty weak.\lAre you sure you're up for me?\pHmm…\pWell, all right!\nWe'll take things easy to start with!$
Okay! Let's see you ignite my passion\nfor battle!$
GRETA: Ow, wait a second!\nYou are tough after all!\pI like you!\nLet's see your FRONTIER PASS.$

I won't allow a halfhearted effort!\nBe ready for a thrashing!$
Come on, REFEREE!\nLet's get this started!$
GRETA: Gaaah! Blown away!\nLet's see your FRONTIER PASS!$
The Guts Symbol took on\na golden shine!$
Arrrgh!\nThis is so infuriating!\pIf we ever battle again, I won't lose!\nDon't you forget it! Bye-bye!$
Your battles shall be waged in\nthe next room. Please step in!$
Where the battling spirit of TRAINERS\nis put to the test!\pI welcome you to the BATTLE ARENA!\pI am your guide to the Set KO Tourney!$
Now, do you wish to take\nthe BATTLE ARENA challenge?$
We await your challenge on\nanother occasion!$
In the BATTLE ARENA, we undertake\nthe Set KO Tourney.\pAll participants enter with a team of\nthree POKéMON.\pThe three POKéMON must be lined up in\nthe order in which they are to appear.\pDuring battle, the POKéMON will appear\none at a time in the preset order.\pOnce a POKéMON enters battle, it must\nremain out until the match is decided.\pIf a match remains undecided in\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\pIf you wish to interrupt your challenge,\nplease save the game.\pIf you don't save, you will not be able\nto continue with your challenge.\pIf you pull off the feat of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\lwe will present you with Battle Points.$
Before showing you to the BATTLE\nARENA, you must save. Is that okay?$
The BATTLE ARENA offers two levels\nof challenge, Level 50 and Open Level.\lWhich is your choice?$
Very well, now select your\nthree POKéMON, please.$
My dear challenger!\pYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for entry.\pTo qualify, you must bring three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\pThey also must not hold the same\nkinds of items.\pEGGS{STR_VAR_1} ineligible.\pWhen you have made your preparations,\nplease do return.$
My dear challenger!\pYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for entry.\pTo qualify, you must bring three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\pThe three different POKéMON\nmust all be Level 50 or lower.\pThey also must not hold the same\nkinds of items.\pEGGS{STR_VAR_1} ineligible.\pWhen you have made your preparations,\nplease do return.$
I shall now guide you to\nthe BATTLE ARENA.$
My dear challenger!\pYou did not save the game before\nshutting down, did you?\pIt is unfortunate, but that has\nresulted in your disqualification\lfrom your challenge.\pYou may, of course, start with a fresh\nchallenge.$
We congratulate you for your splendid\nstring of wins over seven TRAINERS!$
Your achievement will be recorded.\nPlease wait while I save the game.$
In commemoration of your 7-win streak,\nwe present you with this prize.$
{PLAYER} received the prize\n{STR_VAR_1}.$
Oh?\nYour BAG seems to be full.\pI urge you to clear space and\nreturn for your prize.$
Thank you so much for participating!\pPlease wait while I save the game.$
We await your challenge on\nanother occasion!$
We have been looking forward to\nyour arrival.\pBefore I show you to the BATTLE\nARENA, I must save the game.\lPlease wait.$
Shall I record your last BATTLE ARENA\nmatch on your FRONTIER PASS?$
I lost on the REFEREE's decision…\pI don't think it was a good idea to only\nuse defensive moves and not attack…$
I won in judging!\pLanding hits consistently on\nthe opponent's POKéMON worked!$
Our match was declared a draw.\pWhen we ran out of time, both my\nPOKéMON and the opponent's had about\lthe same amount of HP left.$
In the BATTLE ARENA, the order of\nPOKéMON is totally important.\pFor example, if your first POKéMON\nhas certain type disadvantages,\ltry making your second POKéMON one\lwith moves that are super effective\lagainst the first one.\pI think that will be a good way of\nmaking an effective team.$
The Set KO Tourney's rules are listed.$
Which heading do you want to read?$
The Set KO Tourney has special rules,\nunlike standard battles.\pFirst, one battle lasts only\nthree turns.\pIf the outcome is not decided after\nthree turns, it goes to judging.\pThe REFEREE will choose the winner\nbased on how the POKéMON battled.\pAlso, a POKéMON cannot be switched out\nuntil its battle's outcome is decided.$
The first judging factor is “Mind.”\nThis factor evaluates how aggressive\lthe battlers were.\pThe judging is based on how often\nthe TRAINERS ordered the use of\loffensive moves.$
The second judging factor is “Skill.”\nThis factor evaluates how effectively\lPOKéMON moves were used.\pIf a move worked successfully,\nthe Skill rating goes up.\pIf a move failed, the Skill rating\nis lowered.\pIf it was an offensive move, the Skill\nrating goes up if the move was “super\leffective” and goes down if it was\l“not very effective.”\pThe Skill rating will not go up for\nmoves such as PROTECT and DETECT.\pIf the opponent used PROTECT or\nDETECT, and your POKéMON failed to\lhit with a move, its Skill rating will not\lgo down.$
The third judging factor is “Body.”\nThis factor is based on how much HP\lremained at the end of a battle.\pThe rating takes into account how much\nHP a POKéMON had at the start of\lbattle, and what remained at the end.$
A victory snatched from the ARENA\nTYCOON, and a seven-TRAINER sweep!\pWe congratulate you on your most\nsplendid challenge!$
My dear challenger, in recognition of\nyour indefatigable spirit, please\laccept these Battle Point(s).$
{PLAYER} has entered the BATTLE DOME!$

When a TRAINER chains tournament\nwins at the BATTLE DOME, he or she\lgains a reputation as a star.\pTough TRAINERS are drawn by that\nreputation to the BATTLE DOME.\pA true superstar is a TRAINER who\ncan keep winning tournaments.$
I ran into one of the tournament\nfavorites in the very first round.\pOf course I got trashed…$
I would've won if I'd kept this POKéMON\nheld in reserve.\pYou need to check your opponent's\nPOKéMON carefully before choosing\lyour battling POKéMON.$

Hi!\nYou, there!\pAre you thinking that the events here\nare easy since you don't need to have\la raised team of POKéMON?\pI wouldn't be too sure about winning\nthat easily.\pIf you don't have thorough knowledge\nabout POKéMON and their moves,\lit will be tough to keep winning.$
I swapped for a weak POKéMON…\nI thought it was a good kind to have…\pThey wiped the floor with us…$
Things haven't been going my way\nat all.\pYou need to check your opponent's\nPOKéMON during battle to see if\lthey're any good.$
You know how the staff here give you\na few hints about your next opponent?\pWell, I'm a full-grown man, but I have\ntrouble figuring out their hints.$
Like, I'm really tough, but I get bored\nreally easily, so I just kept swapping\land battling over and over.\pSo anyway, when I kept entering\nBattle Swap events, I noticed they\lvaried the rental POKéMON.$
The Battle Swap rules are listed.$
Which heading do you want to read?$
In a Battle Swap event, you may use\nonly three POKéMON.\pWhether you are renting or swapping,\nyour team may not have two or more\lof the same POKéMON.$
You may swap POKéMON only with\nthe TRAINER you have just defeated.\pYou may swap for only those POKéMON\nused by the beaten TRAINER.$
After every battle you win, you may\nswap for one of your defeated\lopponent's POKéMON.\pYou will not be able to swap POKéMON\nwith the seventh TRAINER in the event.$
There are two key points to be aware\nof when swapping POKéMON.\pFirst, when swapping, you can't check\nthe stats of the POKéMON you are\labout to receive.\pSecond, the POKéMON on your team\nare lined up in sequence, depending on\lthe order in which you rented them.\pThis sequence remains unchanged\neven when swaps are made.$
In the Open Level, the rental POKéMON\nand the opposing TRAINERS' POKéMON\lare all Level 100.$
First, we will hold your POKéMON for\nsafekeeping.\pYou may then choose from our\nselection of POKéMON.$

SPENSER: Gwahahah!\pCome see me time and again!\nMy brethren and I will be waiting!$
People and POKéMON, they are but\nthe same…\pTheir individual nature makes them\ngood at certain things, and not good\lat others.$
Rather than trying to make a POKéMON\ndo what it dislikes, try to let it do\lwhat it likes and is good at doing.\pPut yourself in the POKéMON's position\nand consider what moves it would like.$
A POKéMON's nature is a remarkable\nthing…\pSome POKéMON behave in a completely\ndifferent way when they are cornered.$
Are you beginning to understand how\na POKéMON's nature makes it behave?$
Ah… I see a strong, heartfelt bond\nbetween you and your POKéMON…$
Where the hearts of TRAINERS\nare put to the test.\pI welcome you to the BATTLE PALACE.\pI accept challenges to the SINGLE\nBATTLE HALLS.$
Do you wish to take\nthe SINGLE BATTLE HALL challenge?$
In the BATTLE PALACE, there are\nseveral auditoriums for SINGLE BATTLES\lthat are named SINGLE BATTLE HALLS.\pThe SINGLE BATTLES are conducted in\nthe usual way, except with one crucial\lrule that must be obeyed.\pTRAINERS are permitted only to switch\ntheir POKéMON in and out.\pTRAINERS are otherwise forbidden to\ncommand their POKéMON.\pThe POKéMON are to behave according\nto their nature and battle on their own.\pYou must put your trust in your\nPOKéMON and watch over them.\pIf you achieve the honor of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\lwe will present you with Battle Points.\pIf you want to interrupt your\nchallenge, you must save the game.\pIf you don't save before interrupting,\nyou will be disqualified.$

Sigh…\pYou do not have the three POKéMON\nrequired for the challenge.\pTo enter, you must provide three\ndifferent kinds of POKéMON.\pThese POKéMON must all be of\nLevel 50 or lower.\pThey also must not be holding\nthe same kinds of items.\pEGGS{STR_VAR_1} ineligible.\pCome back when you have made\nyour preparations.$

Good. Now, you must select your\nthree POKéMON.$
I must save before I show you to\nthe BATTLE HALL. Is that okay?$
Good.\nNow, follow me.$
I feel privileged for having seen\nyour POKéMON's exploits.\pThe results will be recorded.\nI must ask you to briefly wait.$
To achieve a 7-win streak…\pThe bonds that bind your heart with\nyour POKéMON seem firm and true.$

I must save before I show you to\nthe BATTLE HALL. Is that okay?$
Sigh…\pYou failed to save before you ended\nyour challenge the last time.\pAs a result, your challenge has been\ndisqualified. It is most unfortunate.$
{PLAYER} received the prize\n{STR_VAR_1}.$
For a hardy fellow like me,\nhardy POKéMON are the best.\pOffense is the best defense!\nA relentless attack is the ultimate!\pBut that's not what I wanted to chat\nabout.\pEvery so often a really cute lady\nswings by here.\pShe says that she can tell what\nPOKéMON are thinking.\pI don't know about that part,\nbut she is really cute.\pHuh?\nWhy are you looking at me like that?$
Hmm…\pIt appears that the nature of POKéMON\nand the moves that they have been\ltaught are the keys to battle here.\pTo be more precise, it's how well\nthe moves match the nature of\lthe POKéMON.\pIf your POKéMON is in trouble and\nunable to live up to its potential,\lyou may need to examine how well\lits moves match its nature.$
My POKéMON is usually very docile.\pBut when it's in a BATTLE HALL,\nit sometimes seems to become\ltransformed into something wicked!\pIt becomes totally intimidating.\nIt's shocking, even.$
I wonder what sort of nature a POKéMON\nwould have if it favored enfeebling its\lopponents and chipping away slowly.\pI'd be surprised if it was a LAX nature.\pBut, nah, that can't be right.$
Where the hearts of TRAINERS\nare put to the test.\pI welcome you to the BATTLE PALACE.\pI accept challenges to the DOUBLE\nBATTLE HALLS.$
Do you wish to take\nthe DOUBLE BATTLE HALL challenge?$
In the BATTLE PALACE, there are\nseveral auditoriums for DOUBLE BATTLES\lthat are named DOUBLE BATTLE HALLS.\pThe DOUBLE BATTLES are conducted in\nthe usual way, except with one crucial\lrule that must be obeyed.\pTRAINERS are permitted only to switch\ntheir POKéMON in and out.\pTRAINERS are otherwise forbidden to\ncommand their POKéMON.\pThe POKéMON are to behave according\nto their nature and battle on their own.\pYou must put your trust in your\nPOKéMON and watch over them.\pIf you achieve the honor of beating\nseven TRAINERS in succession,\lwe will present you with Battle Points.\pIf you want to interrupt your\nchallenge, please save the game.\pIf you don't save before interrupting,\nyou will be disqualified.$

In honor of the bond you share with\nyour POKéMON, we present you with\lthese Battle Point(s).$
Would you like to record your latest\nBATTLE PALACE match on your\lFRONTIER PASS?$
The BATTLE HALL rules are listed.$
Which heading do you want to read?$
Here, POKéMON are required to think\nand battle by themselves.\pUnlike in the wild, POKéMON that live\nwith people behave differently\ldepending on their nature.$
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON\nmay prefer to attack no matter what.\pAnother POKéMON may prefer to protect\nitself from any harm.\pYet another may enjoy vexing or\nconfounding its foes.\pDue to its nature, a POKéMON\nwill have favorite moves that it is good\lat using.\pIt may also dislike certain moves that\nit has trouble using.$
There are offensive moves that inflict\ndirect damage on the foe.\pThere are defensive moves that are\nused to prepare for enemy attacks or\lused to heal HP and so on.\pThere are also other somewhat-odd\nmoves that may enfeeble the foes with\lstat problems including poison and \lparalysis.\pPOKéMON will consider using moves in\nthese three categories.$
When not under command by its TRAINER,\na POKéMON may be unable to effectively\luse certain moves.\pA POKéMON is not good at using any\nmove that it dislikes.\pIf a POKéMON only knows moves that\ndo not match its nature, it will often\lbe unable to live up to its potential.$
Depending on its nature, a POKéMON may\nstart using moves that don't match its\lnature when it is in trouble.\pIf a POKéMON begins behaving oddly\nin a pinch, watch it carefully.$
Your Battle Choice challenge\nhas now begun…$
Where the luck of TRAINERS\nis put to the test…\pWelcome to the BATTLE PIKE…\pI am your guide to the BATTLE PIKE…$

Arrgh! I blew my chance!\nI was one room away from the goal!\pIn this place, you'd better watch out\nfor poison, freezing, and so on.$

Oh, it's you…\nNice try…\pI hate to break it to you, but I can't\nreturn your Battle Points…\pI guess we'll have to let it motivate\nus to try harder next time!$
Oh, yes!\nHello there, champ!\pI knew you could!\nI knew you would!\lWe're both big winners!\pI'll return your Battle Points and,\nof course, a little extra from me!$
{PLAYER} obtained\n{STR_VAR_1} Battle Points.$
If you're up for another challenge,\nplease do think of me!$
Not interested?! You shouldn't be\nso afraid to take a chance!$
Oh…$
I backed the wrong TRAINER again!\pMaybe I should be battling normally\nlike everyone else…$
That TRAINER…\pHe's good, but he gets rattled too\neasily to survive the BATTLE DOME…$
Giggle!\nI know a winner when I see one!$
Those TRAINERS…\nWhat are they doing?\lThey should be taking challenges.$
I wonder if they'll be airing interviews\nwith tough TRAINERS today?$
If I opened a restaurant here,\nit'd make money for sure.$
Whew…\pI need to take a breather after\nsome intense battles…\pBut even now, I never take a break\nfrom plotting strategy and combos.$
Ehehe!\nI can tell what POKéMON are thinking!\pPlease!\nCan I see your POKéMON?$
Boo!\nCheapie!$

That's silly! An EGG is asleep!\nI can't talk to it!$
How charming!\nThat little lady claims she can\lunderstand POKéMON!$
I have this feeling that the little girl\nis saying something profound.$
I know something!\pThat little girl plays at the red house\na lot!$
My POKéMON is a {STR_VAR_2}.\nDo you know it?\lIt's quite cute and rather nice.\pThis little one, I could trade with\npride!\pWould you like to trade me a {STR_VAR_1}\nfor my {STR_VAR_2}?$
Oh, it's adorable!\nThank you!\lI promise I'll be good to it!\pOh! I hope you'll be good to\nmy {STR_VAR_2}, too!$
Oh, I'm sorry!\nI don't intend to trade for anything\lbut a {STR_VAR_1}.$
Oh, you won't?\nWell, that's fine, too.\lPlease come visit us again.$
Giggle!\nA SKITTY is so much cuter than I had\limagined. I'm delighted!$
Buhahaha!\pYou couldn't tell it from looking now,\nbut I used to be one tough TRAINER.\pI had a reputation as the toughest\nBEAUTY around, I tell you!\p… … … … … …\pWhat is it now?\nYou don't believe me.\pI'm not like that blowhard woman over\nthere. I'm actually talented!\pLet me prove it to you.\nI can teach your POKéMON special and\lyet cute moves.\pBut my lessons don't come free.\nHow about paying for the moves I teach\lwith a wee bit of Battle Points?$
Buhahaha!\pAre you back to learn special and\nyet cute POKéMON moves?$
Fine, fine, look here!\nWhich move should I teach?$
The move {STR_VAR_1}, is it?\nThat will be {STR_VAR_2} Battle Points, okay?$
Fine, fine, now pick the POKéMON\nI should teach the move to.$
What the…\nYou haven't got enough Battle Points!$
Do you see how skilled I am now?\nI'll take your Battle Points, thanks!$
What's that?\nYou don't want to…\pIf you want to see how skilled I am,\nyou come see me anytime!$
Ihihihi!\pI know it's hard to see now, but I used\nto be one fantastic TRAINER.\pI had a reputation as the most\ninvincible SWIMMER around, I tell you!\p… … … … … …\pWhat's wrong?\nYou don't believe me.\pI'm not like that buffoonish woman over\nthere. I'm actually experienced!\pI can prove it to you.\nI can teach your POKéMON hard and\lyet pretty moves.\pBut my lessons don't come free.\nHow about paying for the moves I teach\lwith a wee bit of Battle Points?$
Ihihihi!\pHave you come to learn hard and\nyet pretty POKéMON moves?$
Those ladies, the way they bad-mouth\neach other, you probably think that\lthey don't get along.\pBut if that were true, they wouldn't\nstay out here together, would they?$
When I was just a wee YOUNGSTER,\nthose ladies were strong and beautiful.\pThey were idols among us TRAINERS.\pEven now, age hasn't dulled their\nabilities.\pIn fact, their POKéMON moves have\ngrown even more polished.\pBut… For some reason, I can't help\nbut feel this…\pTime is so cruel…$

What a TRAINER needs…\pKnowledge…\nStrategy…\lLuck…\lGuts…\lSpirit…\lBravery…\lAnd ability…\pWell, I'm all set in every way!\nI'll be unstoppable at every building!\pHuh? POKéMON?\nWhat's that?$
Do you know about the FRONTIER\nBRAINS?\pThat's what SCOTT calls the seven\nspecial TRAINERS that run the seven\lfacilities in the BATTLE FRONTIER.$
At the BATTLE TOWER, an older girl\ntold me that I have a lot of talent\lfor battling!\pI like POKéMON CONTESTS more!\pBut I'm no good at CONTESTS!\pI guess having talent and liking\nsomething aren't the same.$
We came here to chaperon our\ngrandson.\pBut since we're here, we thought\nwe should get some souvenirs.$
Dear, what do you think of this?\nWouldn't this make a nice gift?\pIt's…PRO…TE…IN?\nIt sounds delicious, doesn't it?$
A lot of the BATTLE FRONTIER's\nfacilities don't allow the use of items\lduring battles.\pThat rule makes things tougher than\nthey already are!$
This is the BATTLE TOWER!\nKeep the win streak as the toughest\lTRAINER!$
This is the BATTLE PALACE!\nKeep your eyes on POKéMON battles!$
This is the BATTLE ARENA!\nLet the toughest teams gather!$
This is the BATTLE PYRAMID!\nAdvance through the Battle Quest!$
BATTLE FRONTIER RANKING HALL\nSet your sights on new records!$
BATTLE POINT EXCHANGE SERVICE CORNER\nExchange your Battle Points!$
Wow!\nIt's huge!\pThe BATTLE TOWER feels special.\nIt's different from the others.$
My grand ambition is to conquer both\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER and the POKéMON\lLEAGUE.\pAnd if my dream comes true…\pI… I'm going to ask MIMI next door\nif she will be friends with me!$
The BATTLE PYRAMID's too harsh!\nI just can't make it to the top!\pSince I'm out of options, maybe I can\nclimb the outside…$
I thrive in darkness…\nYes… What is worthy of me?\lNone other than the BATTLE PYRAMID…\pWhat say you to wandering in darkness\nand in utter and total desperation?$
I didn't sleep for a week, but then\nI put together the ultimate team!\pI can't see myself losing, no joke.\nWe're storming the BATTLE ARENA!$
Did SCOTT bring you here, too?\nWhat is it with that guy?\pIt sounds like he really does know\nhow to spot talented TRAINERS, but…\pI've never seen him battling in person\never.$
ZIGG!\nI believe in you, little buddy!\pI'll make my little ZIGG any favorite\ntasty treats you like if you win!$
ZIGZAGOON looks vacant…$
People call me a busybody,\nbut I can't help it.\pYour hat's on crooked!\nOh, no, trash on the ground!\lOops, it's almost dinnertime!\pI don't know if I can stand to just\nwatch at the BATTLE PALACE…$
I may not look that impressive now,\nbut I once beat a GYM LEADER.\pWho knows, maybe I should give it\nanother shot at glory.$
I'm fast on my BIKE, and that goes for\nthe way I battle, too.\pI win matches in the blink of\nan eye!$
I'm better than my daddy\nat POKéMON.$
Go on, my baby sweetie!\nGo rack up some wins for Daddy!\pYou're just like your mother,\nso you'll be dominating!$
It wasn't easy getting here,\nbut I'd heard about this knockout\lpretty girl at the BATTLE ARENA.\pInstead of her, do you know what\nI found?\pA whole teeming mob of sweaty,\nstinky, and primitive martial artists!$
I sometimes see this really important-\nlooking old man going in there.\pHe has these really awesome POKéMON.\nHe seems really nice, though.$
Do you know it?\nThe legend of the BATTLE PYRAMID?\pWhen there comes a confident TRAINER\nreaching for the golden pinnacle,\lthere shall appear a man among men.\pDon't know that legend?\nWell, of course not!\lI just made it up!\pWhat's it supposed to mean?\nThat, my friend, I can't say!$
Man! Oh man!\nI've never lost once before!\pBut I got wiped out with no saving\ngrace at all!\pAnd then I'm told I don't have any\ntalent?! Man!$
This guy ran into a horribly tough\nTRAINER while he was on the BATTLE\lTOWER challenge.\pNow look at him…\pYou need to be cautious if you ever\ndecide to go to the BATTLE TOWER.$
Yes!\nI've finally got enough Battle Points!\pI guess I'll trade for another giant\nplush DOLL!$
Oh, yeah, okay!\nSo this is the RANKING HALL!\pI'd like to go down in history as\na super champ and have my name\lrecorded here for posterity.$
With you by my side, I can do anything.$
Ooh, darling, you are so wonderful!\pOoh, I just can't wait anymore!\pLet's go to a MULTI BATTLE ROOM\nright this instant!\pIf we get together in the BATTLE SALON,\nthe power of our love will overcome\leveryone we meet.\pWhy, before us, darling, everything\nwill topple like dominoes!$
The BATTLE FRONTIER isn't exclusively\nfor tough TRAINERS.\pMany people with special abilities\nhave been invited, it seems.\pThat man SCOTT…\pHe may have built this place to serve\na bigger objective…$
Excuse me, young one.\nHave you good eyesight?\pThere is an odd tree past here, and to\nmy tired eyes it seems to wiggle.$
Excuse me, young one.\nHave you a good memory?\pI have this feeling there once was\nan odd tree past here.$
I…\nI saw it!\pThere was a sticky sort of a POKéMON\nwith a long tail up ahead!\pIt was hiding under a boulder, and\nit kept staring at me!$
This is the BATTLE DOME!\nYour path to the invincible superstar!$
This is the BATTLE FACTORY!\nSeek out the toughest POKéMON!$
This is the BATTLE PIKE!\nChoose one of three paths!$
This is the BATTLE TOWER.\pTRAINERS bring their best-raised\nPOKéMON for elimination-style matches.$
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?$
{PLAYER} doesn't have the TICKET…\pI'm terribly sorry.\pYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.$
{PLAYER} flashed the TICKET.\pPerfect! That's all you need!\pAnd where would you like to go?$
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!$
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!$
Please sail with us another time!$
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.$
Then, where would you like to go?$
I'm the best out of all my friends.\nBut here…\lI've been useless!$
I want to go to the BATTLE TOWER,\nbut I can't find it even though I have\la map of the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pThis place is just too big!$
I wanted to take a challenge as soon\nas I arrived here.\pBut on the way, I got seasick…\nUrrrrp…$
It's not as if just anyone can come\nhere, you know?\pOnly those TRAINERS who've been\nrecognized as tough are brought here.\pThat's why many TRAINERS don't even\nknow about the BATTLE FRONTIER.$
Hey, bro…\pAre you sure we can make challenges\neven if we don't have any POKéMON?$
Uh…\nI'm sure it'll be okay.\pI think…\pBut remember that big scary guy?\nHe said, “I'll lend you POKéMON!”$
That's the BATTLE FACTORY.\nYou can rent strong POKéMON there.\pBut it makes me wonder.\nWho's raising those rental POKéMON?$
I'm scared of going into the BATTLE\nPIKE because of SEVIPER…\pB-but I came all the way here, so I will\ntry to conquer everything!\l…Shudder…$
Let's play rock, paper, scissors!\nOne, two, three!\p… … … … … …$
Yay! I won!\nI will take the BATTLE PIKE challenge!$
Oh, no…\nI lost.\pI guess I'm not very lucky today.\nI'll put off my BATTLE PIKE challenge\luntil tomorrow.$
I believe I'm the only person here who,\nfor some unknown reason, would choose\lfishing over battling.\pHuh? You can't catch anything here?\nThat's disappointing…$
Today, I'm going to keep battling, no\nmatter what, until I get a Symbol.$
Oh? You're off to challenge\nthe BATTLE DOME?\pI'll wish you the best of luck.\nLet us both win our way up and meet\lin challenges.$
Grandpa, over here!\nThe BATTLE DOME is here!\lGo get 'em, Grandpa!$
Ah, so this here is the BATTLE DOME?\nI won't let GENTLEMEN beat me!\pBut where is the entrance?$
There used to be nothing here not all\nthat long ago.\pBut, now look at this place! Amazing!\nI'll bring my mother out to see this.$
I've finally arrived at the BATTLE\nFRONTIER!\pI'm sure to grab attention with\nmy looks and ability!$
Munch, munch…\pIt looks like this square's filled with\ntough people.\pMunch, munch…$
Crunch, munch…\pA while back, I met this older girl\nat the BATTLE PIKE.\pShe had these eyes that were scary\nin a real ornery way.\pCrunch, munch…\pShe got all furious: “Will you quit\neating!” Then she whaled on me.\pIt was a hair-raising kind of\nscary experience, sure enough.\pCrunch, munch…$
Huh? Will you listen to yourself?\nThat's nothing!\pWhy, the last time I cheered for him,\nour eyes met and sparks flew!$
Whaaaaaat?!\nPfft!\pThat only happened because\nI happened to be sitting next to you!\pThe DOME ACE only looked our way\nbecause my cheering was so loud!$
Oh, shush!\nKeep that racket down!\pYou fair-weather fans should stick\nto cheering for some GYM LEADER!\pThe DOME ACE is mine!\nThe only idol for me!$
Those people squabbling over there…\pIt's hard to believe, but they once\nwere TRAINERS, and good ones, too.\pThey used to be incredibly tough,\nand they were famous, too.\pBut they were obliterated by this\ncertain TRAINER at a tournament.\pThey were so thoroughly whipped,\nthey became smitten by the TRAINER.\pNow they're just fans of the TRAINER.\nThey go cheer for their idol at the\lBATTLE DOME every day now.$
I heard a rumor that someone saw\na POKéMON with an unusually long tail\lsomewhere in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pIt must be adorable. I'm sure of it…\pOh, challenges can wait. I feel driven\nto find the delightful creature!$
There was someone here using a \nPOKéMON I've never seen before.\pI never learned about it at\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL at least.\pI wonder where you can catch POKéMON\nlike that.$
Okay! Next stop, the BATTLE ARENA!\nI'd better get the right POKéMON from\lthe PC Storage System.$
Giggle… I'm going to go through every\nchallenge with just this baby!$
SKITTY: Mya myaaah!$
This is the RANKING HALL.\pThis is where we recognize the immortal\nTRAINERS who left great records in\lBATTLE FRONTIER events.$
BATTLE DOME, BATTLE PIKE,\nand BATTLE FACTORY Records$
BATTLE PALACE, BATTLE ARENA,\nand BATTLE PYRAMID Records$
Hi, is your name on this list?$
Wow, that's super!\nI'll have to try harder, too!$
Oh, is that right?\pIf you saw your friend's name up here,\nI bet it would make you work harder!$
Hmm…\nMy name's not up there…\pWell, it's only natural since I haven't\ntaken any challenges yet.$
Is it your first time here?\nPlease step this way!$
The front lines of POKéMON battling!\nWelcome to the BATTLE FRONTIER!$
For a first-time visitor, we issue\nthe FRONTIER PASS.\pIt's for use at all the facilities\nin the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pHere you are!$
{PLAYER} obtained\nthe FRONTIER PASS.$
{PLAYER} placed the TRAINER CARD\nin the FRONTIER PASS.$
We hope you enjoy all that the BATTLE\nFRONTIER has to offer!$
???: Well, if it isn't {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nYou came out here!$
GUIDE: Oh! MR. SCOTT, sir!\nGood day to you, sir!$
SCOTT: It's great to see you here,\nit really is!\pI hope you'll take your time and\nexplore everywhere.\pNaturally, I hope you'll also experience\nthe pure essence of battling.\pI also have my quarters here, so feel\nfree to visit if you have time.$
I'm your guide to the various facilities\nhere in the BATTLE FRONTIER.$
Which would you like to learn about?$
It is the gigantic tower considered\nto be the BATTLE FRONTIER's symbol.\pThere are four kinds of BATTLE ROOMS\nin the tower for SINGLE, DOUBLE, MULTI,\land LINK MULTI BATTLES.$
The BATTLE DOME is the large building\nshaped like a huge egg.\pEvents named Battle Tourneys are held\nin this facility.\pThe Battle Tourneys are offered in\ntwo courses--for SINGLE and DOUBLE\lBATTLES.$
The BATTLE PALACE is the red building\non the right of the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pThere are two kinds of BATTLE HALLS\nfor SINGLE and DOUBLE BATTLES.$
The BATTLE ARENA is the dojo-like\nbuilding at the center-right of\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\pAn event called the Set KO Tourney\ntakes place at the BATTLE ARENA.$
The BATTLE FACTORY is the large\nbuilding that is the closest to us.\pAn event called the Battle Swap\nis conducted there.\pThe Battle Swap event is offered in\ntwo courses for SINGLE and DOUBLE\lBATTLES.$
The BATTLE PIKE is the building shaped\nlike a POKéMON at the center-left of\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\pAn event called the Battle Choice\nis conducted there.$
The BATTLE PYRAMID is the enormous\npyramid.\pAn event called the Battle Quest\nis conducted there.$
The RANKING HALL is located near\nthe BATTLE TOWER.\pThere, you may see the most fantastic\nrecords left by the TRAINERS that\ltook on the many challenges of\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER.$
The EXCHANGE SERVICE CORNER is near\nthe BATTLE TOWER.\pThe Battle Points you have earned in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER may be exchanged\lfor fabulous prizes there.$
I'm your guide to the basic rules that\nare common to all the challenges\loffered by the facilities in the BATTLE\lFRONTIER.$
What would you like to learn about?$
All the challenges at the BATTLE\nFRONTIER's facilities come in\ltwo courses--Level 50 and Open Level.$
The Level 50 course is open to POKéMON\nup to and including Level 50.\pPlease keep in mind, however, that\nno TRAINER you face will have any\lPOKéMON below Level 50.\pThis course is the entry level for\nbattles at the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pTo begin, we hope you will challenge\nthis course.$
The Open Level course places no limit\non the levels of POKéMON entering\lchallenges.\pThe levels of your opponents will\nbe adjusted to match the levels of\lyour POKéMON.\pHowever, no TRAINER you face will\nhave any POKéMON below Level 60.$
Virtually any kind of POKéMON may take\non the challenges at all facilities.\pEGGS and certain kinds of POKéMON,\nhowever, are not permitted.\pThe numbers of POKéMON required for\nchallenges will depend on the facility.\pAt all facilities, however, two or more\nof the same kind of POKéMON are not\lpermitted.$
When entering a challenge at a BATTLE\nFRONTIER facility, POKéMON may not\lbe holding the same kind of item.\pPlease make sure that all POKéMON\nentering a challenge are holding\ldifferent items.$
I'm your guide to the FRONTIER PASS.$
Which would you like to learn about?$
There are seven facilities at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\pTRAINERS who gain recognition for\ntheir abilities may be rewarded with\lsymbols from each of the facilities.\pTo earn a symbol, TRAINERS may need\nto defeat other TRAINERS in a row,\land may need to win events repeatedly.\pIt's certainly not easy to win symbols.\nI wish you the best of luck!$
It is possible to record one battle\non your FRONTIER PASS.\pYou may record a battle you had with\na friend or friends.\pOr you may record a battle conducted\nat the BATTLE FRONTIER excluding\lmatches at the BATTLE PIKE or\lthe BATTLE PYRAMID.\pYou may choose to record your match\nat the end of a battle.$
Battle Points are rewards given to\nTRAINERS who battled outstandingly\lat the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pYou may trade in your Battle Points\nfor prizes at the EXCHANGE SERVICE\lCORNER.$
SCOTT: Well, hello and welcome!\nHeheh… Sorry about the cramped space.\pAnyway, {PLAYER}{KUN}, let me formally\nwelcome you to the BATTLE FRONTIER.\pThis is my dream come true.\nIt took me years and years, but I've\lfinally given shape to my dream.$
On reflection, it was a terribly long\njourney…\pI left home alone on a quest to find\nstrong TRAINERS.\pNo one can imagine how much effort\nor time it took to make this real.$
But that's all in the past.\nNo point dwelling on that!\pAll I want for you is to enjoy battling\nto your heart's content here.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I want you to have this\nas a memento for all the time our\lpaths crossed on our journeys.$
{PLAYER} obtained\n{STR_VAR_1} Battle Point(s).$
SCOTT: You can check your Battle\nPoints on your FRONTIER PASS.\pThe more success you have here at\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER, the more Battle\lPoints you will collect.\pUse your Battle Points the way you\nsee fit, like trading them for items.$
I'm expecting great things from you!$
SCOTT: Every TRAINER is an individual.\nThey all lead lives of their own.\pBut when they're in a battle,\nit doesn't matter who they are.\pThey're all the same!\pI love the purity of battle,\nwhere everyone is equal.\pThat's why I go everywhere seeking\nTRAINERS who are serious about\lbattling, and invite them here.$
SCOTT: Have you met any of\nthe FRONTIER BRAINS?\pBetter yet, have you obtained any\nsymbols from them?\pI handpicked the FRONTIER BRAINS\nas the toughest TRAINERS anywhere.\pBut I'm sure that seeing how tough\nyou are will startle even them!$
SCOTT: You don't just train for battle,\nright?\pI think I remember you working on\na POKéDEX as well.\pWell, guess what?\pYou may run into wild POKéMON in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER somewhere…\lFufufu!$
SCOTT: Are you enjoying things in\nthe BATTLE FRONTIER?\p…Wait a second…\nOh!\pYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've collected the full set\lof silver symbols!\pThat's more than impressive!\nYou are tough, just as I suspected!\pNormally, I wouldn't do something\nlike this, but this is a special time!\pI want you to have this.\nI'm sure you can put it to proper use.$
SCOTT: I hope you're enjoying\neverything in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\p…Wait a second…\nOh, my disbelieving eyes!\pYour FRONTIER PASS!\nYou've gathered up the full set\lof gold symbols!\pThat's more than stupendous!\nYou're incredible, just as I suspected!\p… … … … … …\p{PLAYER}, you've got to accept this!\pI think you will be able to\nappreciate the value of my gift!$
I must say I have the gift of knowing\na good TRAINER when I see one.\pI'm so glad I had the foresight to\nbring you here!$
Your BERRY POCKET seems to\nbe stuffed.$
SCOTT: Oh, I heard about you!\nHow you ruled the BATTLE TOWER!\lYou beat over 50 TRAINERS in a row?\pThat's fantastic!\nI want you to have this!$
SCOTT: Oh, my! I heard about you!\nHow you overwhelmed the BATTLE TOWER!\lYou beat over 100 TRAINERS in a row?\pThat's ridiculously spectacular!\nYou've got to have this!$
I'll be expecting to hear even greater\nthings about you now!$
Oops, well, if you have too much\nstuff, come back for this later.$
Ah, so you are {PLAYER}{KUN}?\nI've heard tales of your exploits.\pMy name is WALLACE.\pI was once the GYM LEADER of\nSOOTOPOLIS, but something came up.\pSo now, I've entrusted my mentor JUAN\nwith the GYM's operation.\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pGROUDON and KYOGRE, the two POKéMON\nwreaking havoc here, are considered\lto be super-ancient POKéMON.\pBut there aren't just two super-\nancient POKéMON.\pThere is one more somewhere.\pSomewhere, there is a super-\nancient POKéMON named RAYQUAZA.\pIt's said that it was RAYQUAZA that\nbecalmed the two combatants in\lthe distant past.\pBut even I have no clue as to\nRAYQUAZA's whereabouts…$
WALLACE: {PLAYER}{KUN}, do you perhaps\nknow where RAYQUAZA is now?\pIf you do, please tell me.$
WALLACE: The CAVE OF ORIGIN?\pBut that's right here!\nI need you to do better than that!\pPlease, I need you to think about\nwhere RAYQUAZA might be right now.$
WALLACE: MT. PYRE?\pBut when I met the old lady there\nearlier, she made no mention of it.\pI very much doubt that the old lady\nwould try to hide something from me…\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, could you think about this\nmore carefully for me?$
WALLACE: Huh? You don't remember?\nHmm… That's a problem…\pCan't you remember somehow?$

This is a renowned fishing spot.\nAre you getting the itch to fish?$
I hear you, and I like what\nyou're saying!\pI'll give you one of my fishing RODS.$
And, as an added bonus, I'll even throw\nin a little fishing advice!\pFirst, you want to face the water,\nthen use the ROD.\pFocus your mind…\nIf you get a bite, pull on the ROD.\pSometimes you can snag something\nimmediately, but with bigger catches,\lyou need to time the pulls on your ROD\lto haul them in.$
Oh, is that so?\nThat's too bad, then.$
Yo!\nHow's your fishing?$

Hunh?\nIt's not the hip and happening thing?\pWell, hey, you have to tell me,\nwhat's new and what's “in”?$
Hunh?\n“{STR_VAR_2}”?\p… …\p…Uh… Yeah! That's right!\nYeah, I knew that!

Well, if you hear of any happening new\ntrends, come share them with me, okay?$
Yeah, absolutely right!\p“{STR_VAR_1}” is the\ndefinition of “in” right now.$
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound {PLAYER}?\pDEWFORD's GYM LEADER BRAWLY commands\nFIGHTING-type POKéMON.\pGoing against him with NORMAL-type\nPOKéMON is asking for trouble.\pFIGHTING POKéMON will lay a serious\nsmack down on NORMAL POKéMON,\lso be careful!\pWhat's worse, the GYM is as dark as\nthe ocean floor.\pBut it will get brighter after defeating\nthe TRAINERS in your way.\pHey, okay, go for it!$
Whoah! It's turned too bright in here!\pYour future is bright, too!$
Might is right!\nCome on!$
Not enough power…$
Your skill overcame my strength!\nYour technique is commendable!$
There's no need for BRAWLY to be\ninvolved!\pI'll crush you!$
But… How?\nHow could I lose so easily?$
I'm not going to waste this loss.\nI'll use it to motivate me to train!\pOne day I'll become a GYM LEADER…\pNo, I'll become the POKéMON LEAGUE\nCHAMPION!$
Don't you dare brush me off!\nIt's not my fault if you cry!$
Waaaaaaah!\nI lost!$
I battle in the dark to make my heart\nstronger.\pBut because it's so dark, I can never\nsee BRAWLY's face…$
Ufufu…\nAre you stumbling around in the dark?$
Oh, you…\nI don't want to know you!$
You deserve to stay lost and end up\nback at the entrance again!$
I'll show you the gumption of\na sailing man!$
How'd this happen?\nIt's not like me to lose this way!$
Oh, aye! You're worthy of seeing\nour GYM LEADER.$
If you mean to pass, it has to be\nthrough me!$
Grrrrr!\nVastly overpowered!$

I'm BRAWLY!\nDEWFORD's GYM LEADER!\pI've been churned in the rough waves\nof these parts, and I've grown tough\lin the pitch-black cave!\pSo you wanted to challenge me?\nLet me see what you're made of!$
Whoah, wow! You made a much bigger\nsplash than I expected!\pYou swamped me!\pOkay, you've got me.\nTake this GYM BADGE!$
{PLAYER} received the KNUCKLE BADGE\nfrom BRAWLY.$
The KNUCKLE BADGE makes all POKéMON\nup to Level 30, even those you get in\ltrades, obey without question.\pAnd, you'll be able to use the HM move\nFLASH outside of battle.\pIf you'd like, use this TECHNICAL\nMACHINE, too.$

Wow!\nSwamped again!$
BRAWLY: Battling is vast and it's deep.\nYou can't see the bottom.\lIt's just like the sea of HOENN!$
BRAWLY: A wave may draw back, but it\nalways returns to the shore.\pA giant wave of a talent like you…\nI knew you would return!\pOh? You only have one POKéMON\nthat can battle.\pI'm sorry, but I'd like you to come back\nwith at least two POKéMON.$
What's in vogue? Why, it has to be\n“{STR_VAR_1}”!\pI can't imagine what life would be like\nwithout “{STR_VAR_1}”!$
What's in vogue? Why, it has to be\n“{STR_VAR_1}”!\pBut I'm getting kind of bored with it.\pI should look for the next big thing.$
I'm teaching my POKéMON about\n“{STR_VAR_1},”\lbut it's not going well.\pIt's a bit too much, I think.$
I'm studying up on the hip and trendy\n“{STR_VAR_1}” now.\pIs it true that there's a deep link\nbetween “{STR_VAR_1}”\land “{STR_VAR_2}”?$
Oh!\nSo, my hunch was right!\pI'm one step closer to being hip and\nhappening, yowza!$
What?!\nIs that so?!\pIt's not easy for an older fellow like\nme to keep up with trends!$
This whole business about\n“{STR_VAR_1}”…\lIsn't there a TV show on it?$
Across the sea…\pIs “{STR_VAR_1}”\neven more popular?$
I collect official\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\llicensed merchandise.\pI have official\n“{STR_VAR_1}” DOLLS…\pOfficial “{STR_VAR_1}”\nbrand clothing…\pAnd officially licensed\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\lpicture books.\pHeheh, I own!\nI'm not sharing anything with you!$
IDENTIFYING GOOD\n“{STR_VAR_1}” &\lBAD “{STR_VAR_1}”…\pTHE LINK BETWEEN\n“{STR_VAR_1}” AND\lPOKéMON…\pUSEFUL\n“{STR_VAR_1}”…\pIt's neatly jammed with books about\n“{STR_VAR_1}.”$
“{STR_VAR_1}'S\nSCREAM” is the title.$
“{STR_VAR_1}'S\nSMILE” is the title.$
It's titled “THE LAST\n{STR_VAR_1}”.$
It's titled “THE BIRTH OF\n{STR_VAR_1}”.$
I saw “{STR_VAR_1}”!\nCool, huh?\pIt's, like, the coolest thing going!\pIt was awesome!\nIt was the real thing, oh yeah!$
Oh, no, no, no.\pThat alleged\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\lyou claim to have seen--it's not.\pThe authentic article is much…\nHow should I say it?\lSharper, yet more mellow!\pAh, no matter. It's astonishing!$
Hey, listen, I composed a theme song\nfor “{STR_VAR_1}.”\p“{STR_VAR_1}”\nis really popular right now.\pOkay, listen!\n… …\pOh!\n{STR_VAR_1}!\pWonderful\n{STR_VAR_1}!$
… …\pI dare say, chap, it would pay for you\nto work on your singing before you\ltrifle yourself with\l“{STR_VAR_1}.”$
Anyway, as I was saying earlier, we\nshould get together and organize a\l“{STR_VAR_1}” party\lon the island.$
Oh, a smashing good idea!\pIt will settle once and for all\nwho is the best at\l“{STR_VAR_1}.”\lBrilliant, indeed!\pStarting today, our lives will revolve\naround “{STR_VAR_1}”!$
I was thinking, though…\pWouldn't you agree that\n“{STR_VAR_1}” has\lgrown from being something trendy to\lbeing a part of our daily lives?$
Beg pardon?\nThat much, what?\pHowever, it's true that\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\lweighs heavily on your mind, whether\lyou're awake or asleep.\pAbsolutely, you're the\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\lPROFESSOR, old sport!$
If you and me team up as a combo,\nwe'll be invincible when it comes to all\lthings “{STR_VAR_1}”!$
Spot on, my friend!\pWe shall be the\n“{STR_VAR_1}” DUO!\pIsn't that a ripe image?\nHahahah!$
For me, SLUDGE BOMB is at the peak\nof popularity. It's the one.\pHunh? You're telling me that you don't\nknow about SLUDGE BOMB?\pThat's outright pitiful.\nI'll give you one.$
I love SLUDGE BOMB.\pBut POKéMON with the move\n“{STR_VAR_1}”\lare in, too.$
There's a lot to be said for living on\na small island like this in harmony with\lPOKéMON and the family.$
I left the major port of SLATEPORT\nCITY when I married my husband here.\pLife goes by slowly on this little\nisland. But being surrounded by the\lbeautiful sea--that's happiness, too.$
ZIGZAGOON: Guguuh!$
Gorge your eyes on this!\pIt's a SILK SCARF. It's right at the\ncutting edge of fashion, yeah!\pOh, I can see your eyes twinkling!\nYou appreciate my dazzling style!\pOh, you're a delight!\nHere you go. I want you to have it!$
Oh, you don't have room?\pNow, listen tight, this SCARF is a must-\nhave! Why, I would sell all my items\lin order to get it!$
The SILK SCARF raises the power of\nNORMAL-type moves.\pIt's a marvelous SCARF that will go\nwith almost all POKéMON!$
Wow, you bothered to cross the sea\nto visit DEWFORD?\pDid you maybe come here because you\nheard about BRAWLY?\pHe's so cool…\nEveryone idolizes him.$
There's a stone cavern at the edge\nof town.\pI've heard you can find rare stones\nthere.$

WALLACE: Welcome, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\pThat incident in SOOTOPOLIS CITY…\nThat was superb work, putting an end\lto that crisis all by yourself.\pOops!\pIt wouldn't be fair to say that you\nalone ended the crisis.\pYou overcame that difficult situation\nby working as one with your POKéMON.\pWe TRAINERS raise POKéMON by giving\nthem items and by teaching them new\ltechniques for battle.\pBut we ourselves also learn many\nthings from POKéMON.\pAnd this is where your achievements\nare put to the test against what\lothers like you have achieved.\pNow!\pWho can most elegantly dance with\ntheir POKéMON in HOENN?\pShow me right here and now!$
I, the CHAMPION, fall in defeat…\pThat was wonderful work.\nYou were elegant, infuriatingly so.\lAnd yet it was utterly glorious!\pKudos to you, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pYou are a truly noble POKéMON\nTRAINER!$
WALLACE: The POKéMON you sent into\nbattle…\pAt times they danced like a spring\nbreeze, and at times they struck\llike lightning.\pIt was with light, yet surefooted,\nelegance that you led your POKéMON.\pEven I felt bedazzled by your\nmasterful performance!\pYou now stand at the glorious peak\nof the POKéMON LEAGUE.\pI now proclaim you to be the new\nHOENN region…$

Superb, it should be said.$
You deserve every credit for coming\nthis far as a TRAINER of POKéMON.\pYou do seem to know what is needed.\pYes, what a TRAINER needs is a\nvirtuous heart.\pPOKéMON touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and learn good from wrong.\pThey touch the good hearts of\nTRAINERS and grow strong.\pGo! Go onwards!\nThe CHAMPION is waiting!$
Welcome, my name is GLACIA\nof the ELITE FOUR.\pI've traveled from afar to HOENN\nso that I may hone my ice skills.\pBut all I have seen are challenges by\nweak TRAINERS and their POKéMON.\pWhat about you?\pIt would please me to no end if I could\ngo all out against you!$
You and your POKéMON…\nHow hot your spirits burn!\pThe all-consuming heat overwhelms.\pIt's no surprise that my icy skills\nfailed to harm you.$

Ahahaha!\pI'm PHOEBE of the ELITE FOUR.\nI did my training on MT. PYRE.\pWhile I trained, I gained the ability\nto commune with GHOST-type POKéMON.\pYes, the bond I developed with POKéMON\nis extremely tight.\pSo, come on, just try and see if you can\neven inflict damage on my POKéMON!$
Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.$
There's a definite bond between you\nand your POKéMON, too.\pI didn't recognize it, so it's only\nnatural that I lost.\pYup, I'd like to see how far your bond\nwill carry you.\pGo ahead, move on to the next room.$
The POKéMON LEAGUE is only a short\ndistance after the VICTORY ROAD.\pIf you've come this far, what choice\ndo you have but to keep going?$

SCOTT: Hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nSo you came out to this BATTLE TENT!\pThe people in these parts tend to be\neasygoing and laid-back.\pBut, you see, what I'm looking for are\npeople with…\pHow should I say this?\pSomeone bursting with the desire\nand the drive to win.\pIf there were a TRAINER like that,\nI'd immediately…\pWhoops! Never mind!\nKeep working at it!$
SCOTT: Instead of wasting your\ntime with the likes of me, why not\lmake a challenge?$
PROF. COZMO: Oh…\nI never should have let myself be\lconned into telling TEAM MAGMA where\lyou can find METEORITES…\pThat METEORITE from METEOR FALLS…\nIt's never going to be mine now…$
Oh!\nHah?\pThat item…\pCould it be?\pIs it the METEORITE that TEAM MAGMA\ntook from METEOR FALLS?\pPlease, may I have it?\pI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?$
PROF. COZMO: This TM, it represents\nmy feeling of gratitude.\lPlease use it!$
PROF. COZMO: Oh, I can't believe it.\nThis is really, really great!\pThis is really going to help my research!$
PROF. COZMO: Oh, but…\nI'm crushed with disappointment…$
PROF. COZMO: Please, may I have that\nMETEORITE?\pI'm not asking for it for free.\nHow about in exchange for this TM?$
PROF. COZMO went off to METEOR FALLS\non ROUTE 114 with some people from\lTEAM MAGMA.$
Poor PROF. COZMO…\nHe's so depressed… I feel sorry for him.$
Look at PROF. COZMO…\nHe's so happy! I think it's cute.$
I'm the MOVE TUTOR.\pI know all the moves that POKéMON\nlearn--every one of them--and I can\lteach POKéMON those moves.\pI can teach a move to a POKéMON\nof yours if you'd like.\pI'll do it for a HEART SCALE.\nI'm collecting those now.$
Oh! That's it! That's an honest to\ngoodness HEART SCALE!\pLet me guess, you want me to teach\na move?$
Which POKéMON needs tutoring?$
Which move should I teach?$
Sorry…\pIt doesn't appear as if I have any move\nI can teach that POKéMON.$
{PLAYER} handed over one HEART SCALE\nin exchange.$

Hunh? There isn't a single move that\nI can teach an EGG.$
I'm having a hard time deciding if I\nshould make my SKITTY evolve or not.\pI only have to use this MOON STONE,\nbut it's so hard to decide…\pIf I make it evolve, it will become\nmuch stronger.\pBut it will look so different, too.$
SKITTY: Miyao?$
This NUGGET I found here…\nI suppose I'll have to sell it, seeing\las how it has no other use.$
Oh, hello.\nYou are?\pOkay, your name's {PLAYER}{KUN}.\nI can see that you're a TRAINER.\pSo that means you use the POKéMON\nStorage System I developed.\pHow I arrived at that conclusion is\na simple deductive process.\pYou spoke to me because you wanted\nto access something on this PC.\pOh, I'm sorry. I'm LANETTE.\pHonestly, I'm glad to meet you--it's\ngreat you're using the Storage System.\pIf you could, please visit me at home.\nMy house is on ROUTE 114.$
I wonder what POKéMON looked like\nlong, long ago?\pMaybe the FOSSIL MANIAC at the edge\nof town will know.$
In the fields of FALLARBOR, we plant\nseedlings of hardy trees that thrive\leven in volcanic ash.$

No one believes me, but I saw this\ngigantic POKéMON in the sky.\pIt seemed to squirm as it flew toward\nROUTE 131.\pBy the way… Sniff…\nUm… You, uh…smell singed.\pWere you at a volcano or something?$
I want to go to the POKéMON GYM,\nbut something's blocking the way.\pAfter all the bother I went through\ntraining on ROUTE 120…$

Living on top of trees is okay.\pBut sometimes BUG POKéMON come in\nthrough windows.\lIt can be really startling.$
There are POKéMON that evolve when\nyou trade them! That's what I heard.$

The lovers of BIRD POKéMON aspire\nto join this GYM.\pAs a member of the FORTREE GYM,\nI'm not allowed to lose!$
It was too much of a load for me\nto bear…$
The world is huge, and there are\ncountless tough TRAINERS.\pI'm going to keep training and make\nmyself even stronger.$
There's no need for WINONA, our GYM\nLEADER, to deal with you!\pI'm plenty good enough for you!$
WINONA, I…\nI lost!$
WINONA is cute and she's strong.\nShe's the ultimate LEADER!\pBlush…$
WINONA taught me personally!\nYou can't beat me easily!$
I was beaten…$
Thanks to WINONA, the people of\nFORTREE can live without fear.$
When WINONA takes to battle, her face\nshines with beautiful determination…\pI'm not letting you witness that\nlovely sight!$
Urk!\nI couldn't stop you.$
You'd better watch it!\nDon't get distracted staring at WINONA\lor you'll go crashing down in a heap!$
You'd better know that there are all\nsorts of FLYING-type POKéMON.\pYou do know that, right?$
You seem to know your stuff!$
Sure, you beat me all right.\nBut you'd better watch it! Our LEADER\lWINONA's POKéMON are all business.$
I am WINONA. I am the LEADER of\nthe FORTREE POKéMON GYM.\pI have become one with BIRD POKéMON\nand have soared the skies…\pHowever grueling the battle, we have\ntriumphed with grace…\pWitness the elegant choreography\nof BIRD POKéMON and I!$
Never before have I seen a TRAINER\ncommand POKéMON with more grace\lthan I…\pIn recognition of your prowess,\nI present to you this GYM BADGE.$
{PLAYER} received the FEATHER BADGE\nfrom WINONA.$
With the FEATHER BADGE, all POKéMON up\nto LV 70, even those received through\ltrades, will obey your every command.\pYou will also be able to use\nthe HM move FLY outside of battle.\pAnd this…\nThis is a gift from me.$
TM40 contains AERIAL ACE.\pIts speed…\nNo POKéMON should be able to avoid it.\p… … … … … …$

WINONA: We humans can never escape\ngravity's pull on the ground.\pBut by striving for excellence,\nwe have the power to soar!\pYou have scaled the pinnacle as\nthe reigning CHAMPION.\pPlease, allow me to see your power\nat full flight!$
I failed to reach your height again…$
WINONA: Even though I have lost,\nthe wings of my heart remain unbroken.\pI can rise and soar again and\nyet again.\pI am convinced of it!$
WINONA: We humans can never escape\ngravity's pull on the ground.\pBut by striving for excellence,\nwe have the power to soar!\pYou have scaled the pinnacle as\nthe reigning CHAMPION.\pPlease, allow me to see your power\nat full flight!\pOh, no… Do you have but one\nPOKéMON with you?\pPlease return with two POKéMON\nat the very least.$
Wrooooaaar! I need it!\nI have to get me a {STR_VAR_1}!\lI'll do anything for it!\p…Uh… Did you hear that?\nMy shout from the bottom of my heart?\pHaving heard that, you will trade\nyour {STR_VAR_1} for my {STR_VAR_2},\lwon't you?$
Oh, yeah, right on!\p{STR_VAR_1}, welcome!\n{STR_VAR_2}, you take care!$
Uh, no, I don't think so.\nThat isn't a {STR_VAR_1}.$
No? You won't trade me?\nEven after I bared my heart to you?$
I'm going to make VOLBEAT super\nstrong from this moment on!\pI hope you do the same with PLUSLE!$
Trading POKéMON with others…\pIt's as if you're trading your own\nmemories with other people.$
ZIGZAGOON: Gumomoh?$
People… POKéMON…\pTheir hidden powers are aroused by\nliving in natural environments…$
Let this old woman see if your hidden\npower has awoken…\pI hold a coin in my hand.\pNow, tell me, have I palmed it in\nthe right hand? Or in the left?$
Oh! Yes, correct!\pWe shall try again.\pIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left?$
Oh! Yes, correct!\pWe shall try again.\pIn which hand have I palmed the coin?\nThe right or left?$
Oh! Splendid!\nYour hidden power has awoken!\pHere, take this and awaken the hidden\npower of your POKéMON.$
HIDDEN POWER is a move that changes\nwith the POKéMON.$
No, too bad.\nYou guessed wrong.$
While speaking about POKéDEXES,\nI remembered something.\pI met this TRAINER, STEVEN, when\nI was searching for rare stones.\pHoo, boy, he had some amazing POKéMON\nwith him.\pThey weren't just rare, they were\ntrained to terrifying extremes!\pHe might even be stronger than the\nGYM LEADER in this town…$
What's that thing you have there?\p… … … … … …\pOh, it's called a POKéDEX?\nIt's really awesome!$
By being together with POKéMON,\npeople make more and more friends.\pAnd that brings the world closer\ntogether. I think it's wonderful!$
There!\nGo, BIRD POKéMON!$
Heheh, I asked my WINGULL to run\nan errand for me.$
Good!\nWelcome back, WINGULL!\pHuh? What is this?\nWhat is it holding?\pA MENTAL HERB?\nIt must have picked it up somewhere.\pBut I'm not a TRAINER, so you can\nhave it.$
Thanks to my WINGULL, I have friends\nwho live far away.$
WINGULL: Pihyoh!$
The tree houses of FORTREE are great!\pI think it's the number one town for\nliving together with POKéMON.$
POKéMON and people have adapted to\nnature for survival.\pThere's no need to make nature\nconform to the way we want to live.$
ZIGZAGOON: Bufuu!$
SUPER REPEL lasts a long time,\nand it gets the job done.\pIt's much better than an ordinary\nREPEL.$
I always stock up on more items than\nI'm sure I'll need.\pYou never know what might happen.\nBetter to be safe than sorry!$
A RARE CANDY makes a POKéMON grow\nimmediately by one level.$
Listen, kid, are you working\non a POKéDEX?\pHmm… Go to the SAFARI ZONE.\nThat's my suggestion.$
Have you done anything at\nthe RECORD CORNER?\pIt's pretty neat. It mixes and matches\nthe records of TRAINERS.\pI don't know quite how it works,\nbut it's cool. It's exciting, even!$
Oh, wow, you have a POKéNAV!\nAnd it's just like mine!\pDo you know about POKéNAV's\nMATCH CALL system?\pAccess it, and you can chat with\nregistered TRAINERS anytime.\pIt also shows you which TRAINERS\nwant a rematch with you.\pIt's really nifty! Those DEVON guys\nsure know what they're doing!$
Hey, you.\nIt gets awfully dark ahead.\lIt'll be tough trying to explore.\pThat guy who came by earlier…\nSTEVEN, I think it was.\pHe knew how to use FLASH, so he ought\nto be all right, but…\pWell, for us HIKERS, helping out those\nthat we meet is our motto.\pHere you go, I'll pass this on to you.$
Teach that hidden move FLASH to\na POKéMON and use it.\pIt lights up even the inky darkness\nof caves.\pBut, to use it, you need the GYM BADGE\nfrom DEWFORD's POKéMON GYM.$
My name is STEVEN.\pI'm interested in rare stones,\nso I travel here and there.\pOh?\nA LETTER for me?$
STEVEN: Okay, thank you.\pYou went through all this trouble to\ndeliver that. I need to thank you.\pLet me see…\nI'll give you this TM.\pIt contains my favorite move,\nSTEEL WING.$
STEVEN: Your POKéMON appear quite\ncapable.\pIf you keep training, you could even\nbecome the CHAMPION of the POKéMON\lLEAGUE one day. That's what I think.\pI know, since we've gotten to know each\nother, let's register one another in\lour POKéNAVS.\p… … … … … …$

MT. CHIMNEY's JAGGED PASS…\pNow this is what I've always wanted\nin a mountain.\pThis jagged bumpiness…\nIt rocks my soul!$
Losing left me bitter!$
Yes, I did lose at POKéMON…\pBut, when it comes to the love of\nthe mountains, I have you beat!$
This place isn't your casual hike.\nIt's not suited for a picnic.$
Ohhh, no!\nThe ground is too bumpy…$
Did you know?\pSome people cleverly ride their\nbicycles up this horribly bumpy pass.$
Will you ever be back in this area?\nIf you do return, I'd like a rematch.$
Picnics are fun wherever you go.\nJust like POKéMON!$
I only lost because the ground is\ntoo bumpy!$
I'll forget about losing and just\nenjoy this bumpy hike.$
JAGGED PASS is hard to walk on.\nIt's a good place for training.$
It was all over while we were still\ntrying to find a good footing…$
If I had an ACRO BIKE, I'd be able to\njump ledges.$
When I get more used to this bumpiness,\nI'll be sure to win!\pCan you register me in your POKéNAV?$
I got used to this bumpiness.\nI sing while I climb now.$
It's still not easy to battle on this\nbumpy ground…$
I should get an ACRO BIKE from RYDEL\nin MAUVILLE CITY…$
Wah!\nWhat are you doing here?\pWhat am I doing in a place like this?\pWhat business is it of yours?$
Urrrgh…\pI should've ducked into our HIDEOUT\nright away…$
Okay, oh-kay!\nI admit it--you're strong!\pDon't worry about me.\nGo wherever you want!$
Oh! This boulder is shaking in response\nto the MAGMA EMBLEM!$
Aiyeeh! It's awfully scary to shoot\ndown the mountain in one go!$
I feel like I'm falling apart…$
My bicycle bounced around so much,\nmy rear end's sore…$
I climb this hill every day.\nI have confidence in my strength!$
Hmm…\nWhat went wrong?$
What is that odd rock protrusion\na little up the hill from here?$
MAY: {PLAYER}{KUN}! Long time no see!\pOh? While I visited the hot springs,\nyou got the LAVARIDGE GYM BADGE.\pYou must have collected\ngood POKéMON…\lNo, I believe you raised some.\pI guess it would be okay for you to\nhave this.$
MAY: With those GO-GOGGLES, you'll\nhave no trouble getting through the\ldesert near ROUTE 111.\pBut, wow, {PLAYER}{KUN}…\nChallenging GYMS…\pYou're trying hard because you don't\nwant to lose to me, I bet!\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I think I should challenge\nyour dad in PETALBURG GYM.\pSee you again!$
BRENDAN: {PLAYER}, hey, it's been a while.\nHow's it going?\pHmm…\nThat's a decent collection of BADGES.\pAll right, then.\nYou may as well have this.$
BRENDAN: Keep those with you if you're\nplanning on going into that desert near\lROUTE 111.\pThere should be some POKéMON that\nare exclusively desert-dwellers.\lYou might look around for those.\pAs for me…\nI'm considering challenging NORMAN,\lthe GYM LEADER of PETALBURG.\pUnlike you, {PLAYER}, your dad looks like\nhe really is tough.\pSee you around!$
I have here an EGG.\pI'd hoped to hatch it by covering it in\nhot sand by the hot springs.\lBut that doesn't seem to be enough…\pI've heard it would be best if it were\nkept together with POKéMON and\lcarried about.\pYou are a TRAINER, yes?\nAnd your POKéMON radiate vitality.\pSo, what say you?\nWill you take this EGG to hatch?$
Good! I hope you'll walk plenty with\nthis here EGG!$
{PLAYER} received the EGG.$
Oh? You've too many POKéMON.\nThere's no room for this EGG…$
As you wish, then…\pIf you have a change of heart about\nhatching this EGG, I will be here.$
Every so often, an EGG will be found at\nthe POKéMON DAY CARE.\pOr at least that's how the rumor goes.$
We draw as much hot water as we need,\nand yet the hot springs never run dry.\pIsn't it magical?\pThese hot springs appear near active\nvolcanoes. Veins of water under the\lground are heated by magma to well up\las hot springs.$
Being buried in this hot sand is…\nSigh…\pSo warm and heavenly…\pEh? Gyaah! Ouch!\pA POKéMON nipped my backside!$
Oh, you like hot springs, do you?\pThat's surprising for one as young\nas you.$
I bathe in the hot springs every day.\pI want to become a beautiful and strong\nGYM LEADER like FLANNERY.$
If people put POKéMON in hot springs,\nit might be seriously strange.\pWhy, it might be an electric bath, or\na bubble bath, or even a lava bath…$
They're claiming that these hot springs\nare good for calming nervous tension,\lrelieving aching muscles, solving\lromantic problems, and attracting\lmoney…$

Yow! That was a scorching-hot battle!$
Owowowowow!\nYikes, it's hot!$
I'm blinded by sweat in my eyes…$
Being buried in hot sand promotes\ncirculation.\pIt's effective for healing pain in\nyour joints.$
I'm trying to relieve my stress.\nDon't come along and stress me out!$
I hope FLANNERY flames you good!$
Haaah… Whew…\pIf you spend too much time buried in\nhot sand, it tuckers you out…$
You must be getting tired by now.\nYou'd like to rest in the hot sand,\lwouldn't you?\pBut you should know that maintaining\nyour willpower is an important ability\lfor all TRAINERS.$
Play with fire, and be burned…$
Your skill is real…\nBut our LEADER FLANNERY is strong.\pIf you don't watch yourself, you'll be\nburned seriously.$
Can your POKéMON withstand\n392-degree heat?$
It didn't burn hotly enough…$
The temperature of magma is\n392 degrees.\pYour POKéMON beat me, so they should\neasily survive in magma.$
Um…\nOkay, I'll battle with you.$
Oh, but you're too strong.$
I'm going to be a pretty and strong\nTRAINER just like FLANNERY.$
Come on, get with it!\nLet's go before my feelings cool!$
It's so hot, and yet my heart is\nclutched by ice…$
The way the battling spirit burns\nwithin you, you may stand a chance\lagainst our LEADER.$
See how the flames blaze wildly?\nThey flare in anticipation of my win!$
Something didn't go right.$
Well, so what? I say so what?\nI can walk on hot coals barefoot!\p…Don't even think about trying it!$
As much as I love mountains,\nI especially love volcanoes.$
Well, it seems to me I lost without\never being in control.$
I stay here because I became a fan\nof FLANNERY's power.\pHehehehe.$
Welcome… No, wait.\pPuny TRAINER, how good to see you've\nmade it here!\pI have been entrusted with the…\nNo, wait.\pI am FLANNERY, and I'm the GYM\nLEADER here!\pUh…\nDare not underestimate me, though\lI have been LEADER only a short time!\pWith skills inherited from my grand-\nfather, I shall, uh…demonstrate the\lhot moves we have honed on this land!$
Oh…\nI guess I was trying too hard…\pI… I've only recently become\na GYM LEADER.\pI tried too hard to be someone\nI'm not.\pI have to do things my natural way. If\nI don't, my POKéMON will be confused.\pThanks for teaching me that.\nFor that, you deserve this.$
{PLAYER} received the HEAT BADGE\nfrom FLANNERY.$
If you have a HEAT BADGE, all POKéMON\nup to Level 50, even those you get in\ltrades from other people, will obey\lyou completely.\pAnd, it lets POKéMON use the HM move\nSTRENGTH outside of battle.\pThis is a token of my appreciation.\nDon't be shy about taking it!$
That TM50 contains OVERHEAT.\pThat move inflicts serious damage on\nthe opponent.\pBut it also sharply cuts the SP. ATK\nof the POKéMON using it. It might not\lbe suitable for longer battles.$

On MT. CHIMNEY's peak, there's a local\nspecialty that you can buy only there.\pGive it to a POKéMON--it will be elated.$
I think POKéMON get closer to their\nTRAINERS if they spend time together.\pThe longer the better.\nThat's what I think.$

Even when TRAINERS enter the same\nkind of POKéMON, they all seem to use\ldifferent moves for appeals.\pIt's just like the way people have\ndifferent styles for battling.$
I think the POKéMON look smarter\nthan their TRAINERS. By a lot.$
When all's said and done, I still love\nSMARTNESS CONTESTS.\pThat intellectual green color…\nIt's so… So… Cool.$
MC: Are you entering the BEAUTY\nCONTEST, too? Good luck!$
JUDGE: Ah, every POKéMON here is\na model of pristine beauty!\pWhy, I almost forgot to score them!$
A POKéMON this beautiful…\nThere isn't another one like it.\pEveryone's eyes will be glued to\nmy beauty.$
Waaaah!\pI brushed and groomed my POKéMON\ncarefully for this CONTEST…\pBut I overdid it…\nMy POKéMON's coat turned all scraggly…\pWhat should I do?$
This AURORA BEAM is so dazzling,\nthe JUDGE won't be able to see it.\pUh, wait a second…\nThat'll be meaningless, then!$
This pretty POKéMON looks just like\nme when I was younger.\pRight when I said that, my husband\nspewed the coffee he was drinking.\pDid I say something funny?$
You know, if I win at a BEAUTY\nCONTEST, sure it makes me\lhappy. More than usual, anyway.$
Wahahahah!\pWill you take a gander at all those\npretty POKéMON!\lI just love this sort of glitz!$
You can't always win on just beauty\nalone.\pYou have to groom your POKéMON so\nit's nice and glossy like mine.$
MC: Uh-oh! Hello!\nWe're in the middle of a CONTEST!\pPlease enter at our registration\ncounter and come out, okay?$
JUDGE: Oh, such charming and cute\nappeals!\pOh, my goodness! What a perfectly\nadorable WATER SPORT appeal!$
Oh, no… My sweet AZURILL was\ndistracted by another POKéMON.$
My POKéMON has never won in a battle,\nbut put it in a CONTEST and look out!$
My POKéMON's PETAL DANCE is a marvel\nof elegance.\pI won't let anyone disturb its\nperformance.$
Everyone's POKéMON are very cute.\pHowever, if my POKéMON were to make\na cute appeal…\pI'm sure that it would be so much \ncuter than the others.$
My child is in this CONTEST.$
Come on, dear. Go for it!\nYour POKéMON is the best!$
I think that girl over there is\nthe cutest of the lot.\pWhat's that? They're judging\nPOKéMON by their looks?$
Ohh, seeing all these cute POKéMON,\nthey make we want to get my own!\pI'm going to go catch some!$
BEAUTY CONTEST STAGE\nBE ALLURED BY BEAUTIFUL POKéMON!$
CUTENESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE CHARMED BY CUTE POKéMON!$
SMARTNESS CONTEST STAGE\nBE IMPRESSED BY SMART POKéMON!$
Yippee!\pThe lady at the reception counter\ngave me a case for {POKEBLOCK}S!$
Make {POKEBLOCK}S and put them in there.\pWhen you make a {POKEBLOCK}, everyone\nhas to put in a different BERRY.$
Congratulations!\pI did a painting of your POKéMON to\ncommemorate its victory…\pWell, your POKéMON's appeals were\nso fantastic, it spurred me into\lpainting better than I usually do.\lLook, see?$
What do you think? I'm confident in\nwhat I've done, but do you like it?\pA work of this caliber, it wouldn't look\nout of place in an art museum.\pHuh? An art museum really is looking\nfor paintings?\pDo you think I should take this there?$
What, really? Then, sure, I will take\nthis painting there right now.\pI'll give it a proper title, too.\pI hope they'll like it and consider\nexhibiting this.\pPlease check if they did accept this.\nThank you!$
Oh, that's right!\pAs a memento of me painting your\nPOKéMON, please take this.$
{PLAYER} received a RIBBON.$
{PLAYER} put the RIBBON on\n{STR_VAR_1}.$
Okay, see you!$
Oh… Then, I guess I'll just take\nthis home with me…\pBut, you know, I would like to take\nthis to the art museum… Okay?$
Oh, fine, that's the way it is.\nI will hang this in my own house.\pI'll just have to try harder next time.\nWell, be seeing you.$
Hoo, boy… Master Rank CONTESTS,\nhere I come.\pThe world will know that my dearest\nPOKéMON is the cutest being in all\lexistence. The time has come!\lUheheheh.$
You can see a whole variety of\nPOKéMON here.\pThat's why I make this place a regular\npart of my daily stroll.$
Wow, coming out to a CONTEST is\na feast for these eyes!\pWould you look at all the POKéMON\nthat just scream to be painted?$
The TOUGHNESS CONTEST is like\nextreme, man!\pThose muscular appeals…\nCascading sweat… I swoon!$
Day in and day out, I lavished my care\non this POKéMON.\pIts condition is peaking.\nToday, victory is mine!$
I made {POKEBLOCK}S with Mom, Dad, and\nBig Sister. They turned out great!\pI bet you can make smoother, better\n{POKEBLOCK}S if you have more people.$
Hm, so they doubled the guests by\nusing POKéMON as attractions?\pHm, well, maybe I should make a cute\nPOKéMON our inn's mascot.\pI wonder if that will attract more\nguests to stay with us?$
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\pSince that TEAM AQUA came to town,\nthe tourists have been staying away.$
Hey, down in front!\nI can't see the TV!$
Amazing! You're telling me a POKéMON\nfound someone's lost item?\pThat's something. If we had some smart\nPOKéMON like that…\pWe could recover anything that our\nguests mislaid…$
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV!\pI heard that someone busted\nthe TEAM AQUA HIDEOUT.\pThanks to that, we just booked\na reservation from a big group.\pIt was a company called… Uh…\nGAME something…$
Amazing! A house-sitting POKéMON\ncaught a burglar?\pThat's something. If we had a tough\nPOKéMON as a security guard…\pWe would be able to provide our guests\nwith greater safety.$
Oh, sorry, sorry!\nI was too involved in watching TV.\pOh, yes. A big group of guests arrived\na little while ago.\pThey booked in as GAME FREAK,\nso I guess they must make games.\pUh-oh, I'd better get working on\ntheir dinner!$
I'm the GAME DESIGNER.\pOh, is that right?\nYou're working on a POKéDEX?\pIt's tough trying to complete it,\nbut don't give up.\pIf you do complete it, please come\nshow me.$
Wow! That's awesome!\nYep, it's totally awesome!\pThis POKéDEX is completely filled!\nYou really must love POKéMON!\pI'm so impressed!\pLet me give you something in\nrecognition of your feat!$
Me? You're talking to me?\nI'm the PROGRAMMER.\pI wonder what the SLOTS are\nlike here.$
I'm the GRAPHIC ARTIST! Aren't the\nPOKéMON of HOENN interesting?$
The girl TUBERS, they're cute, hey?\nTo battle against a cute TUBER…\pWhoop, it's so awesome!\pAnd the TWINS! Aren't they cute?\nA 2-on-2 battle with TWINS…\pWhoop, it's unbearably fun!$
The sea breeze tickles my heart.\nIt feels wonderful here!$
You never know when and where\npeople will challenge you.\pThat's why I never leave home without\nmy GAME BOY ADVANCE.$
SCOTT: … … … … …\n… … … … … Zzz…\p… … … … … Huh?!\nOh, sorry, sorry! I was snoozing!\pI came to check out this POKéMON\nCONTEST thing.\pI have to admit, it does look quite\nentertaining, but…\pConsider me a purist--I prefer\nbattles and tough TRAINERS.\pBut that's just me.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I hope you'll enjoy everything\nlike the GYMS, CONTESTS, BATTLE TENT,\lthe whole works!$
SCOTT: I think it does take strategy\nto win a CONTEST.\pDevising CONTEST strategies is one way\nof becoming a better TRAINER, I'd say.$
Don't they have set dates for their\nclear-out sales?\pI watch TV, but they never show any\ncommercials.$
Yes! I've been waiting a long time for\nthis clear-out sale.\pThey have items that you can only get\nhere. I'm going to load up, that I am!$
Ohh… I'm bone-dry thirsty!$
It's a VENDING MACHINE.\nWhich drink would you like?$
Clang!\pA can of {STR_VAR_1} dropped down.$
Clang!\pScore! An extra can of {STR_VAR_1}\ndropped down!$
Not enough money…$
Decided against buying a drink.$
Welcome to LILYCOVE DEPARTMENT STORE.$
Whenever I come to the DEPARTMENT\nSTORE, I always end up buying all sorts\lof things because it's so fun.$
Today, my mom is going to buy me some\nnice furniture.$
I'm buying something for my AZUMARILL\nas a reward for winning a CONTEST.$
AZUMARILL: Maririroo!$
1F: SERVICE COUNTER\n    LOTTERY CORNER\p2F: TRAINER'S ZONE\p3F: BATTLE COLLECTION\p4F: TM CORNER\p5F: POKé DOLL FLOOR\pROOFTOP: ROOFTOP PLAZA$
Wireless Communication is a\nlot of fun, isn't it?\pI think it lets you do things that\nweren't possible before.\pFor instance, you can now trade\nwith people you couldn't before.\pI think it's going to be exciting!$
I want to spread the word about how\nfun Wireless Communication can be.$
Learn to use items properly.\nThat's basic, really.$
My husband is waiting at home.\nWhat would make a good gift for him?$
I'm leaving on a long journey soon.\nI need to stock up on items.$
For quickly toughening up POKéMON,\nitems are the best.\pPROTEIN boosts ATTACK,\nand CALCIUM raises SP. ATK.$
I want my POKéMON to have more\nendurance.\pI'm trying to decide whether to raise\nDEFENSE with IRON, or SP. DEF with ZINC.$
I gave a CARBOS to my POKéMON,\nand its SPEED went up.$
Hmm…\pAn attacking move…\nOr a defensive move…\pIt's no easy matter to decide which TM\nmoves should be taught to POKéMON…$
There are so many different kinds of\nTM moves.\pA catalog I read said there are fifty\ndifferent kinds.$
I'd like to get all the different TMs,\nbut a POKéMON learns only four moves.$
This place is full of cute DOLLS.\pI should buy some for me, instead of\njust for my children.$
I'm not big enough to raise POKéMON,\nso I'm getting a cute DOLL instead.$
They sell many cute MATS here.\pI wonder which one I should get?\nMaybe I'll buy them all…$
I think they closed the rooftop\nbecause the weather is wild today.$
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\pI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present…$
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?$
{PLAYER} doesn't have the TICKET…\pI'm terribly sorry.\pYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.$
{PLAYER} flashed the TICKET.\pPerfect! That's all you need!\pAnd where would you like to go?$
Please sail with us another time!$
SLATEPORT CITY it is, then!$
BATTLE FRONTIER it is, then!$
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.$
Then, where would you like to go?$
Until they finish making the ferry,\nwe sailors have nothing to do…\pI wish they'd get a move on, the folks\nat the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT.$
The ferry S.S. TIDAL is finally in\noperation.\pThe folks at the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT\nmust've worked extra hard.\pWell, it's my turn to get busy now!$
POKéMON are partners to people.\nThey aren't our tools.\pUnfortunately, there are some people\nwho fail to understand that…$
KECLEON: Ruroro?$
Huh? What? What's that?\pI'm not near awake yet…\nYou can have this…$
Yawn…\pSleep is essential for good health…\nSleep and regain health…$
Oh, my, my! Are you traveling alone?\nBut you're so young! Good for you!\pI'm sure my kids could learn a thing\nor two from you!\pMe? I'm a master of {POKEBLOCK}S.\pIf I get serious just a little, why,\nI can concoct great {POKEBLOCK}S.\pWould you like to learn from me,\na master of {POKEBLOCK}S?$
Oh? Are you sure?\pYou shouldn't always try to do\neverything by yourself, dear!$
Oh, good! You're a smart soul!\nThis is a bit long, so listen up!\pAre you ready?\pIf you look at {POKEBLOCK}S, you should see\nthat they are rated on how they feel.\pThe lower the feel rating,\nthe better it is. Don't forget this!\pA good {POKEBLOCK} has a low feel\nrating and a high level.\pA POKéMON can eat more good\n{POKEBLOCK}S than ordinary ones, too.\pAnd this is important.\pIf you want to make smooth {POKEBLOCK}S,\nuse different kinds of BERRIES.\pDon't be stingy--the kinds of BERRIES\naffect the smoothness of {POKEBLOCK}S.\pAnd another thing.\pThe more people blending BERRIES,\nthe smoother the {POKEBLOCK}S.\pThat's why you should talk to other\npeople and make {POKEBLOCK}S together.\pThat's about all you need to know to\nmake good {POKEBLOCK}S.\pIf everyone had POKéMON they love,\nsmooth {POKEBLOCK}S, and a loving family,\lthe world would be a happier place.\pDon't give up, dear!$
When my wife gave birth to quadruplets,\nyou bet I was shocked.\pBut, now, seeing them play together,\nit makes me happy.$
We're having MULTI BATTLES, but I know\nI'm going to win.$
We like mixing stuff at\nthe RECORD CORNER.\pBut what gets mixed up?$
We're going to make super {POKEBLOCK}S\nwith a BERRY BLENDER!$
I want to brag about how tough my\nPOKéMON is, so we're going to enter\la CONTEST together.$
This planet's biggest mysteries are\nat the bottom of the sea.\pSomebody said that, but I don't know…$
There's a deep underwater trench\nbetween MOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\pThat's what someone told me, anyway.$
Welcome to LILYCOVE MUSEUM.\pPlease take the time to enjoy our\ncollection of fantastic artwork\lfeaturing POKéMON.$
I'm the CURATOR of this MUSEUM of\nfine arts.\pIt's heartening to see someone so\nyoung as you in our MUSEUM.\pHave you viewed our collection of\npaintings already?$
Ah, then let me not disturb you.\nPlease, do take your time.$
Oh? I do believe that you seem to\nbe a POKéMON TRAINER.\pHave you an interest in paintings,\ntoo?$
I see…\pI'm honored that you would visit\nus in spite of that.$
Ah, excellent!\nYou do like paintings!\pThen, may I ask you to come with me?$
It's a very old painting.\nThe paint is peeling here and there.$
It's an odd landscape with bizarre\nand fantastic scenery.$
It's a painting of a beautiful, smiling\nwoman with a POKéMON on her lap.$
It's a painting of a legendary POKéMON\nfrom long ago.\pThe artist painted this from\nimagination.$
It's a painting of GRASS POKéMON\nswaying in a breeze.\pThey appear to be enjoying the wind's\ngentle caress.$
It's a delicious-looking painting\nof BERRIES.\pThis painting could make you hungry!$
It's a replica of a famous sculpture.\pIt depicts an ancient BIRD POKéMON.$
It's a big POKé BALL carved from\na black stone.\pIt was apparently used in festivals\nin the olden days.$
It's a huge stone tablet inscribed\nwith POKéMON and dense text in the\lsmall characters of an ancient,\lunreadable language.$
Hmmm…\nWhat works of great magnificence…$
Battling with POKéMON is fun,\nI'll grant you that.\pBut one mustn't forget our love for\nthe fine arts.$
This ART MUSEUM… Well, you could\nsee many fantastic paintings.\pAnd the CURATOR is a wonderful person.\pAmong artists like myself, this MUSEUM\nis an inspiration.$
This lady is pretty!\nShe's like Mommy!$
This POKéMON is adorable!\nJust like our little boy!$
I'd heard that this ART MUSEUM got\nin some new paintings.\pSo, naturally I hurried over.\pAre the new paintings up on\nthe second floor?$
Lately, the CURATOR has been\nunusually cheerful.\pI bet something good happened for him.\nDefinitely.$
I aim to see many great paintings\nhere and learn from them.\pI have this dream of one day having\nmy artwork exhibited here.$
The ART MUSEUM has become a favorite\ntourist destination.\pIt's great for LILYCOVE…\nNo, great for the HOENN region!\pThis is what I've heard--a lone TRAINER\nprocured all the paintings upstairs.$
This is our special exhibit hall.$
As you can plainly see, there is not\na single painting on exhibit.\pHere, I don't wish to exhibit works of\nso-called classical art.\pSuch classical works you can see on\nour ground floor.\pI wish to exhibit work that is far\ndifferent from the classics.\pArt, after all, is not restricted to old,\nfamous works!\pThis exhibit hall, I wish to fill it with…\pModern and vibrant artworks of\nPOKéMON seemingly ready to spring\lforth into glorious life!$
I beg your pardon. I didn't intend\nto monopolize the conversation.\pNow, as you are young, and yet\nobviously well traveled…\pYou must encounter lively POKéMON\nand works of art depicting them.\pIf you were to come across such\na painting, may we ask you to obtain\lthe artist's permission to exhibit\lit here?$
I wish to fill this exhibit hall with\nmodern and vibrant paintings of\lPOKéMON.$
Thanks to you, we've added a new\npainting to our collection!\pI've heard it depicts your POKéMON.\nTruly magnificent!\pThank you so very, very much!$
Ah! It's you!\n{PLAYER}!$
Isn't this marvelous?\nThis collection of paintings!\pEach one of them flawless!\nNone better than another!\pThese paintings have attracted\nmore guests to our ART MUSEUM.\pSincerely, I thank you, {PLAYER}.\nThis is my dream come true!$
This is merely a token of my gratitude.$
I will keep this for you until we\nmeet again.$
Ah, so good to see you, {PLAYER}!\pIt's an honor to have you visit us\non your busy journeys.\pPlease, relax and do enjoy your\nvisit with us.$
It's a picture frame with pink-colored\nadornments.$
It's a picture frame with\nyellow-colored adornments.$
It's a picture frame with\nblue-colored adornments.$
It's a picture frame with\nred-colored adornments.$
It's a picture frame with\ngreen-colored adornments.$
It's a painting of POKéMON.$
I've been away awhile, so the new\npaintings up here surprised me.\pI wish someone would paint my POKéMON\nthis pretty.$
Well… So this is where they show\nthe topical POKéMON paintings.\pI see, these new paintings are indeed\nrather amusing.$
Wow, is that right?\nThese paintings are of your POKéMON.\pIsn't that just the ultimate joy for\na TRAINER?$
Uh…\nOh, yes, I'm the MOVE DELETER.\pI can make POKéMON forget their moves.\pWould you like me to do that?$
Which POKéMON should forget a move?$
Which move should be forgotten?$
{STR_VAR_1} knows only one move\nso it can't be forgotten…$
Hm! {STR_VAR_1}'s {STR_VAR_2}?\nThat move should be forgotten?$
It worked to perfection!\p{STR_VAR_1} has forgotten\n{STR_VAR_2} completely.$
Come again if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.$
What?\nNo EGG should know any moves.$
Hm!\pYour {STR_VAR_1} doesn't seem willing\nto forget SURF.$
I wonder how many kinds of POKéMON\nthere are in the world.\pIt'd be great to cross seas and\ntrade POKéMON with people far away.$
I've been hearing about some rotten\nscoundrels who steal POKéMON and rip\loff METEORITES.$
Those rotten scoundrels who steal\nPOKéMON and rip off METEORITES…\pI haven't seen them around recently.$
Oh, wow!\nIt's {PLAYER}!$
I've heard the news!\nYou're really strong, aren't you?\pWe always argue about who is the\nstrongest of all TRAINERS here.\pSo when I heard about you, I decided\nto be your fan!\pI hope you'll keep on battling other\ntough TRAINERS.\pThat way, we'll be able to see more\nof your hot, hot battles.\pThat will make the others here see\nexactly how great you are.\pRemember, I'm cheering for you,\n{PLAYER}!$
Yo, {PLAYER}!\nYou're the one we want to win!$
The others, they don't know that\nyou're the best of the best!\pIsn't that right, {PLAYER}?\nShow them you've got guts!$
I hate to say this, but the TRAINER\neverybody's talking about is\l{STR_VAR_1}, no question about it!\pThat TRAINER's power…\nIt's out of the ordinary.$
Darn it… I've been telling people\nthat {STR_VAR_1} is the best now…\pBut no one wants to listen…$
I've been hearing things about\na tough new TRAINER.\pThis TRAINER's supposed to be beating\nGYM LEADERS, even.\pDo you know anything about this\nnew TRAINER?$
Oh!\n{PLAYER}!\pGo for it!\nI'm pulling for you!$
Sigh…\nBRAWLY…\pOh, no! Wait!\nThat's not right! No, no, no!\pI'm your fan through and through!\pSo make me proud!\nGo for it!$
I can't help it, I can only get to\nlike BRAWLY…$
Nobody understands the charm of\nBRAWLY…\pI don't care!\pEven if I'm the only one, I'm going\nto keep cheering for BRAWLY!$
Whatever anyone says, my favorite\nTRAINER is DEWFORD's GYM LEADER\lBRAWLY!$
You've surpassed your own father in\nevery regard!\pI'm telling you, so there's no question\nabout it at all!$
Even when things turned bleak,\nyour father never gave up.\pThis I know to be true.\pYou never give up even if you lose!\nSo keep on battling!$
NORMAN battled with more power,\ncharisma, and showmanship than you.\pEven though people may say that\nyou're strong…\pYou've still got a long way to go\ncompared to your father.$
You're beginning to get the same\nair of awe NORMAN exudes.\pBut there's something conclusively\ndifferent between you and NORMAN.\pI can't tell you what that is.\nYou'll have to find it yourself.$
Everyone here, we're all huge fans\nof POKéMON battles.\pWe discuss who we consider to be\nthe strongest of all TRAINERS.\pIf you were to become famous,\nwe might even become your fans!$
Oh, woweee! It's {PLAYER}!\nFor real, too!\pPlease, shake my hand, shake my hand!$
I'll always cheer for you, {PLAYER}!\nAlways, always!\pI don't want to see you lose ever,\n{PLAYER}.\pBecause I know you're really,\nreally strong, {PLAYER}!$
{STR_VAR_1} is really cool…\pEveryone thinks so, right, right?$
{STR_VAR_1} really is cool, don't\nyou think so?\pEven if it's just me, I'm going to keep\ncheering my favorite TRAINER.$
My favorite TRAINER is…\pCool…\pStrong…\pAnd really nice…\pI wish there was a TRAINER like that…$
Whoa! It's {PLAYER}!\nWicked!\pWhen I grow up, I want to be strong\nlike you, {PLAYER}!$
Even if I'm the only one…\pYou'll always be the only one\nI cheer for, {PLAYER}!\pBecause I believe in you, {PLAYER}!$
{STR_VAR_1} is so wickedly cool…\nI want to shake hands with my hero.$
Even if I'm the only one…\pI'm never going to stop being\n{STR_VAR_1}'s fan!\pBecause I've heard, {STR_VAR_1}\nnever loses!$
{PLAYER}!\nYou are amazing after all!\pEver since I set eyes on you,\nI knew that you were great.\pIt looks like my eyes didn't deceive me.$
Who cares about the others.\nI'm in your corner!\pYou don't need to worry. Just get\nout there and battle like always.$
You're a pretty decent TRAINER,\nI think.\pBut I also think that {STR_VAR_1}\nis number one right now.\pThat's just my opinion.\nDon't worry about it too much.$
Wow, you really are strong.\nMaybe even stronger than {STR_VAR_1}.\pBut {STR_VAR_1} needs me.\pIf I don't cheer for {STR_VAR_1},\nwho will?$
You've changed my mind!\nYou are strong, aren't you?\pI'd like you to tell me how you managed\nto get so strong!$
The tougher the situation, the more\nattractively you battle.\pI can't wait for your next battle!$
Among the recently hot TRAINERS,\n{STR_VAR_1} is the standout.\pThat toughness, it's simply not normal.\pYou're doing okay, but you're not in\nthe same class as {STR_VAR_1}.$
You are really popular…\pYou're strong, and you're caring to\nPOKéMON. No one can knock you.\pBut, you know, I believe in {STR_VAR_1}.\p{STR_VAR_1} is definitely stronger!\nI'm positive!$
You…\pImpressive!$
Your true worth, it is fine if only\nI recognized it.\pThe others I doubt will understand\nthe hidden power that beats within.$
Yes, I see strength in your eyes.\pBut!\pYou still haven't realized your\npotential.$
It is true that you are tremendously\npowerful.\pBut!\nI can tell…\pThat strength cannot be considered\ntrue strength yet!\pTrue strength is…!\n… …\pActually, I have no idea, either.$
MOM: {PLAYER}, we're here, honey!\pIt must be tiring riding with our things\nin the moving truck.\pWell, this is LITTLEROOT TOWN.\pHow do you like it?\nThis is our new home!\pIt has a quaint feel, but it seems to be\nan easy place to live, don't you think?\pAnd, you get your own room, {PLAYER}!\nLet's go inside.$

{PLAYER} switched shoes with the\nRUNNING SHOES.$
MOM: {PLAYER}, those shoes came with\ninstructions.\p“Press the B Button while wearing these\nRUNNING SHOES to run extra-fast!\p“Slip on these RUNNING SHOES and race\nin the great outdoors!”$
… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\pTo think that you have your very own\nPOKéMON now…\lYour father will be overjoyed.\p…But please be careful.\nIf anything happens, you can come home.\pGo on, go get them, honey!$
If you use a PC, you can store items\nand POKéMON.\pThe power of science is staggering!$
PROF. BIRCH spends days in his LAB\nstudying, then he'll suddenly go out in\lthe wild to do more research…\pWhen does PROF. BIRCH spend time\nat home?$
Um, um, um!\pIf you go outside and go in the grass,\nwild POKéMON will jump out!$
It's dangerous if you don't have\nyour own POKéMON.$
Um, hi!\pThere are scary POKéMON outside!\nI can hear their cries!\pI want to go see what's going on,\nbut I don't have any POKéMON…\pCan you go see what's happening\nfor me?$
You saved PROF. BIRCH!\nI'm so glad!$

Don't push yourself too hard, dear.\nYou can always come home.\pGo for it, honey!$
MOM: What is that, honey? A POKéNAV?\nSomeone from DEVON gave it to you?\pWell, honey, how about registering\nyour mom?\p… … …$
Registered MOM\nin the POKéNAV.$
Fugiiiiih!$
Huggoh, uggo uggo…$
INTERVIEWER: …We brought you this\nreport from in front of PETALBURG GYM.$
There is a movie on TV.\pTwo men are dancing on a big piano\nkeyboard.\pBetter get going!$
It's the instruction booklet for the\nRUNNING SHOES.\p“Press the B Button to run while\nwearing your RUNNING SHOES.\p“Lace up your RUNNING SHOES and hit\nthe road running!”$
DAD: Hm?\pHey, it's {PLAYER}!\pIt's been a while since I saw you,\nbut you look…stronger, somehow.\pThat's the impression I get.\nBut your old man hasn't given up yet!\pOh, yes, I have something for you.\nThis came to you from someone named\lMR. BRINEY.$
DAD: Hm, a TICKET for a ferry?\pIf I recall, there are ferry ports in\nSLATEPORT and LILYCOVE.$
I'd better get back to PETALBURG GYM.\pMOM, thanks for looking after the house\nwhile I'm away.$
MOM: That DAD of yours…\pHe comes home for the first time in a\nwhile, but all he talks about is POKéMON.\pHe should relax and stay a little longer.$
MOM: Is that a breaking news story?$
We bring you this emergency\nnews flash!\pIn various HOENN locales, there have\nbeen reports of a BZZT…colored\lPOKéMON in flight.\pThe identity of this POKéMON is\ncurrently unknown.\pWe now return you to the regular\nmovie program.$
MOM: {PLAYER}, did you catch that?\pWhat color did the announcer say\nthat POKéMON was?$
MOM: Well, isn't that something!\nThere are still unknown POKéMON.$
The clock is stopped…\pBetter set it and start it!$
MOM: {PLAYER}, how do you like your\nnew room?\pGood! Everything's put away neatly!\pThey finished moving everything in\ndownstairs, too.\pPOKéMON movers are so convenient!\pOh, you should make sure that\neverything's all there on your desk.$
{PLAYER} flipped open the notebook.\pADVENTURE RULE NO. 1\nOpen the MENU with START.\pADVENTURE RULE NO. 2\nRecord your progress with SAVE.\pThe remaining pages are blank…$
{PLAYER} took a closer look at the\nHOENN region map.$
It's a Nintendo GameCube.\pA Game Boy Advance is connected to\nserve as the Controller.$
Oh, hello. And you are?\p… … … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … … …\pOh, you're {PLAYER}{KUN}, our new next-door\nneighbor! Hi!\pWe have a {STR_VAR_1} about the same\nage as you.\pOur {STR_VAR_1} was excited about making\na new friend.\pOur {STR_VAR_1} is upstairs, I think.$
Like child, like father.\pMy husband is as wild about POKéMON\nas our child.\pIf he's not at his LAB, he's likely\nscrabbling about in grassy places.$
That {RIVAL}!\pI guess our child is too busy with\nPOKéMON to notice that you came\lto visit, {PLAYER}{KUN}.$
Oh, {RIVAL} went out to ROUTE 103\njust a little while ago.\pLike father, like child.\n{RIVAL} can't stay quietly at home.$
I think it's wonderful for people to\ntravel with POKéMON.\pBut you should go home every so often\nto let your mother know you're okay.\pShe might not say it, but I'm sure she\nworries about you, {PLAYER}{KUN}.$
Huh?\nWho… Who are you?\p… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\pOh, you're {PLAYER}{KUN}.\nSo your move was today.\pUm… I'm MAY.\nGlad to meet you!\pI…\nI have this dream of becoming friends\lwith POKéMON all over the world.\pI… I heard about you, {PLAYER}{KUN}, from\nmy dad, PROF. BIRCH.\pI was hoping that you would be nice,\n{PLAYER}{KUN}, and that we could be friends.\pOh, this is silly, isn't it?\nI… I've just met you, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\pEheheh…\pOh, no! I forgot!\pI was supposed to go help Dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON!\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I'll catch you later!$
Hey!\nYou…\pWho are you?\pOh, you're {PLAYER}, aren't you?\nMoved in next door, right?\pI didn't know that you're a girl.\pDad, PROF. BIRCH, said that our new\nnext-door neighbor is a GYM LEADER's\lkid, so I assumed you'd be a guy.\pMy name's BRENDAN.\nSo, hi, neighbor!\pHuh? Hey, {PLAYER}, don't you have\na POKéMON?\pDo you want me to go catch you one?\pAw, darn, I forgot…\pI'm supposed to go help my dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON.\pSome other time, okay?$
Hi, neighbor!\pDo you already have your\nown POKéMON?$
Huh?\nWho… Who are you?\p… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\pOh, you're {PLAYER}{KUN}.\nSo your move was today.\pUm… I'm MAY.\nGlad to meet you!\pI…\nI have this dream of becoming friends\lwith POKéMON all over the world.\pI… I heard about you, {PLAYER}{KUN}, from\nmy dad, PROF.

I forgot!\pI was supposed to go help Dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON!\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I'll catch you later!$
POKéMON fully restored!\nItems ready, and…$
Hey!\nYou…\pWho are you?\pOh, you're {PLAYER}, aren't you?\nMoved in next door, right?\pI didn't know that you're a girl.\pDad, PROF. BIRCH, said that our new\nnext-door neighbor is a GYM LEADER's\lkid, so I assumed you'd be a guy.\pMy name's BRENDAN.\nSo, hi, neighbor!\pHuh? Hey, {PLAYER}, don't you have\na POKéMON?\pDo you want me to go catch you one?\pAw, darn, I forgot…\pI'm supposed to go help my dad catch\nsome wild POKéMON.\pSome other time, okay?$
POKéMON fully restored…\nItems all packed, and…$
It's {RIVAL}'s POKé BALL!\pBetter leave it right where it is.$
MAY: {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pI was just checking my POKéDEX.\pThere's still a lot of POKéMON that\nI've seen but haven't caught.\pAnd there are many others that\nI think will evolve.\pI wonder where I should go catch\nsome POKéMON next?$
MAY: I wonder where I should go catch\nsome POKéMON next?\pWouldn't it be funny if we ran into each\nother, {PLAYER}{KUN}?$
BRENDAN: Hey, it's {PLAYER}.\pI was just checking out my POKéDEX.\pThere are still many POKéMON that\nI need to catch, I know, but this\lis looking pretty good.\pChecking this POKéDEX out gives me\nthe urge to hit the road again.$
BRENDAN: I'm having a hard time deciding\nwhere I should catch POKéMON next.\pHey, {PLAYER}, if I see you while I'm out\ncatching POKéMON, I can pitch you a\lbattle if you'd like.$
Hunh? PROF. BIRCH?\pThe PROF's away on fieldwork.\nErgo, he isn't here.\pOh, let me explain what fieldwork is.\pIt is to study things in the natural\nenvironment, like fields and mountains,\linstead of a laboratory.\pThe PROF isn't one for doing desk work.\nHe's the type of person who would\lrather go outside and experience\lthings than read about them here.$
The PROF isn't one for doing desk work.\nHe's the type of person who would\lrather go outside and experience\lthings than read about them here.$
PROF. BIRCH is studying the habitats\nand distribution of POKéMON.\pThe PROF enjoys {RIVAL}'s help, too.\nThere's a lot of love there.$
PROF. BIRCH: So, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\pI've heard so much about you from\nyour father.\pI've heard that you don't have your\nown POKéMON yet.\pBut the way you battled earlier,\nyou pulled it off with aplomb!\pI guess you have your father's blood\nin your veins after all!\pOh, yes. As thanks for rescuing me,\nI'd like you to have the POKéMON you\lused earlier.\p{PLAYER} received the {STR_VAR_1}!$
PROF. BIRCH: While you're at it, why not\ngive a nickname to that {STR_VAR_1}?$
PROF. BIRCH: If you work at POKéMON\nand gain experience, I think you'll make\lan extremely good TRAINER.\pMy kid, {RIVAL}, is also studying\nPOKéMON while helping me out.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, don't you think it might be\na good idea to go see {RIVAL}?$
PROF. BIRCH: Great!\n{RIVAL} should be happy, too.\pGet {RIVAL} to teach you what it\nmeans to be a TRAINER.$
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, don't be that way.\nYou should go meet my kid.$
PROF. BIRCH: {RIVAL}?\nGone home, I think.\pOr maybe that kid's scrabbling around\nin tall grass again somewhere…\pIf you or your POKéMON get tired,\nyou should get some rest at home.$
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pI heard you beat {RIVAL} on\nyour first try. That's excellent!\p{RIVAL}'s been helping with my research\nfor a long time.\p{RIVAL} has an extensive history as\na TRAINER already.\pHere, {PLAYER}{KUN}, I ordered this for my\nresearch, but I think you should have\lthis POKéDEX.$
{PLAYER} received the POKéDEX!$
PROF. BIRCH: The POKéDEX is a high-tech\ntool that automatically makes a record\lof any POKéMON you meet or catch.\pMy kid, {RIVAL}, goes everywhere\nwith it.\pWhenever my kid catches a rare POKéMON\nand records its data in the POKéDEX,\lwhy, {RIVAL} looks for me while I'm out\ldoing fieldwork, and shows me.$
PROF. BIRCH: Countless POKéMON\nawait you!\pArgh, I'm getting the itch to get out\nand do fieldwork again!$
MAY: Oh, wow, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nYou got a POKéDEX, too!\pThat's great! Just like me!\nI've got something for you, too!$
MAY: It's fun if you can get a lot of\nPOKéMON!\pI'm going to look all over the place\nbecause I want different POKéMON.\pIf I find any cute POKéMON, I'll catch\nthem with POKé BALLS!$
Oh? Your BAG's full.$
MAY: I wonder where I should go look\nfor POKéMON next?$
BRENDAN: Huh…\nSo you got a POKéDEX, too.\pWell then, here.\nI'll give you these.$
BRENDAN: You know it's more fun to\nhave a whole bunch of POKéMON.\pI'm going to explore all over the place\nto find different POKéMON.\pIf I find any cool POKéMON, you bet\nI'll try to get them with POKé BALLS.$
Hey, your BAG's full.$
BRENDAN: Where should I look for\nPOKéMON next…$
It's a serious-looking machine.\nThe PROF must use this for research.$
It's a PC used for research.\nBetter not mess around with it.$
It's crammed with books on POKéMON.$
It's a book that's too hard to read.$
PROF. BIRCH: Now…\p{PLAYER}{KUN} and {RIVAL}, I've had the two\nof you help me study POKéMON.\pThanks to your help, new facts\nare coming to light.\pIt appears that in the HOENN region,\nthere are also POKéMON from other\lregions.\pIt goes to show how rich and varied\nthe natural environments of HOENN\lhappen to be.\pThat's why I think it's necessary for\nme to upgrade your POKéDEX to\lthe NATIONAL Mode.\pHere, let me see your POKéDEX units.$
MAY: Eheheh!\pIt's so cool that even my POKéDEX\nis getting updated!\pIt's because you went out and caught\nso many POKéMON, {PLAYER}{KUN}!$
BRENDAN: I went out all over HOENN\nand checked out POKéMON.\pYou can thank me for getting\nthe NATIONAL Mode POKéDEX.\pYep, you're lucky, {PLAYER}!$
PROF. BIRCH: Okay, all done!$
{PLAYER}'s POKéDEX was upgraded\nto the NATIONAL Mode!$
PROF. BIRCH: But listen.\nYou've become the CHAMPION,\lbut your POKéMON journey isn't over.\pThere is no end to the road\nthat is POKéMON.\pSomewhere, there is a grassy patch\nthat's waiting for you!$
MAY: I think I'll take a short break\nfrom fieldwork.\pI think I'll help the PROF here for\na while.$
BRENDAN: For the time being,\nI'm taking a break from fieldwork.\pI'll be helping out the PROF here\nfor a while.$
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nLet's have a look at your POKéDEX.\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pYes, there's no doubt about it.\pYou really have completed the HOENN\nregion's POKéDEX.\pThat's more than just impressive.\pI have a gift for you.\pConsider it my show of appreciation\nfor the fantastic work you've done.\pMy gift is a rare POKéMON only found\nin another region!\pYou can have any one of these\nthree POKéMON!$
PROF. BIRCH: These are rare POKéMON\nonly found in another region!\pYou can have any one of these\nthree POKéMON!$
PROF. BIRCH: The FIRE POKéMON\nCYNDAQUIL caught your eye!\pYou're as sharp as ever!\pSo the CYNDAQUIL is your choice?$
PROF. BIRCH: The WATER POKéMON\nTOTODILE is your choice!\pYou know how to pick a good one.\pSo, you'll take the TOTODILE?$
PROF. BIRCH: The GRASS POKéMON\nCHIKORITA is your choice!\pYou sure know what you're doing.\pSo, you'll take the CHIKORITA?$
PROF. BIRCH: Take your time before\nyou decide.\pThey're all invaluable POKéMON.$
PROF. BIRCH: I see!\nYou picked a fine POKéMON!$
{PLAYER} received the {STR_VAR_1}\nfrom PROF. BIRCH!$
Want to give a nickname to\nthe {STR_VAR_1} you received?$
PROF. BIRCH: Listen, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\nYou've completed the HOENN POKéDEX,\lbut your POKéMON journey isn't over.\pThere is no end to the road\nthat is POKéMON.\pSomewhere, there is a grassy patch\nthat's waiting for you!$
You received the promised POKéMON.\nBetter leave the others alone.$
Oh, you don't have any room for\nthis POKéMON.$
MAY: {PLAYER}{KUN}, after this…\nWhat are you going to do?\pAre you going to keep battling\nand sharpening your skills?\pOr are you going to try filling\nthe NATIONAL POKéDEX?\pI'm staying here to help the PROF.$
BRENDAN: Rather than collecting\nPOKéMON, I prefer slowly and \lsteadily raising the one I chose.$
MAY: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nHave you gone to that place,\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER?$
BRENDAN: Hey, {PLAYER}!\nHave you gone out to that place,\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER?$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\pSCOTT: Hi, hi, {PLAYER}!\nIt's me, SCOTT.\pI'm aboard the S.S. TIDAL now.\nIt feels great to be on the sea!\pBy the way…\pThere's this place that I'd like to\ninvite you to for a visit.\pIf you're interested, board a ferry\nat either SLATEPORT or LILYCOVE.\pI'll fill you in on the details when\nwe meet. I'll be waiting!\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!$
When TEAM MAGMA has roll call, we get\nimportant guarding assignments in\lthe order that we line up.\pThat's why I'm stuck off in this corner.\nI'm always late to roll call!$
I'm always late for training sessions,\ntoo!\pI hate to say it, but I'm wimpy…$
Okay, I'll try to put a little more\neffort into things from now on…$
Our leader told us to dig into\nMT. CHIMNEY, so we dug and dug.\pAnd in the course of digging, we came\nacross something that blew our minds!\pWhat did we find?\pFuhahaha!\nI'll tell you if you beat me!$
Arrgh!\nTaken down!$
I won't tell you after all.\nYou'll find out when you get there!\pIt'd be better if you saved surprises\nto the end, don't you think?$
What, what, what?\pOnly TEAM MAGMA members are supposed\nto be in here!\pBut you're not dressed in TEAM MAGMA's\nuniform…\pYou rouse my suspicion!\nBattle with me!$
Aiyiyi…\nMy pride as a TEAM MAGMA member…$
If you suffer from chills, you should\njoin TEAM MAGMA.$
Hold it right there!\pYou don't really expect me to keep\nmy trap shut and let you waltz by me?$
Ooh wow!\nI concede!$
Maybe it would've been better if I did\njust let you go unchallenged…$
Ahah!\nAn intruder!$
Graaah!$
I've already lost.\pDo I really need to keep running\naround in a circle?$
Oh, oh!\nAn intruder!$
Mutter…$
Actually, I'm no expert at battling…$
I don't have a bone to pick with you.\nI'm just following orders!$
I may have lost, but…$
We dug up something beyond belief!\nAnd, we got the BLUE ORB!\pAll that's left is for our leader to…\nFufufu… Fwahahaha!$
I can't stand heat. Maybe I should've\njoined TEAM AQUA instead…$
Yeah, I really may not be right for\nTEAM MAGMA…$
Don't you get lonely for the sea\nbeing in a place like this?$
You can hear tremors here sometimes.\pCould it be the volcano rattling?\nOr is it GROU…\pWhoops!\nNo, no, never mind!$
You're a fiery battler.\nJust like a volcano!$
You just happened to win this time,\nbut that doesn't matter.\pTEAM MAGMA's goal is about to be\nreached!$
One of our guys was freaking out that\nhe lost his MAGMA EMBLEM…\pWait a minute!\nWas it you who found it?$
I'm having trouble believing this…$
I'm getting this feeling that our plan\nis going to end in failure…$
What did I do to deserve this guard\nposting?\pMy left ear is burning up!$
I'm getting heat exhaustion…$
Do you think it's odd that we're wearing\nhoods in this magma-filled volcano?$
We joined so we can help our leader\nachieve his fantastic vision.\pI don't care if you're with TEAM AQUA\nor if you're just some kid passing by.\pNo one interferes with us and gets\naway with it!$
Oh, no!\nYou're not to be trusted at all!$
Listen to me.\nTEAM MAGMA is right!\pDon't listen to TEAM AQUA.\nDon't believe their lies!$
I understand everything our leader\nsays. But you know what?\pDoing stuff like digging up a super-\nancient POKéMON and ripping off\lsomeone's METEORITE…\pI think we're going a little too far.\nWhat do you think?$
Yeah, I think we are doing something\nwrong somehow.$
You know, losing to you cleared my mind.\pThe next time I see our leader,\nI'm going to ask him about what we do.$
I want to see GROUDON, too, but they\nwon't let me see even its tail…\pIt's got me feeling really frustrated.\pOh, no!\nI blabbed about GROUDON!$
I guess it's impossible to win if one\ndoesn't have a calm mind…$
I wonder if GROUDON even has a tail?$
Fuhahaha!\nSoon! Very soon!\lOur grand objective will be achieved!$
Grrr…\nI've come so far, but now this?$
MAXIE, sir!\nAn intruder is headed your way!$
You're not finished yet!\nYou're not getting by me easily!$
Was I that easy to knock down?$
C-come on, one more match…$
Hehehe!\nYou made it this far, so I'll tell you!\pThat's right!\nUp ahead, GROUDON is sleeping!\pMAXIE went to GROUDON just seconds\nago!\pIt's going to awaken real soon!\nHehe! Hehehe!$
Taken down again…\nHehe…$
…And while you wasted time with me,\nMAXIE should have awakened GROUDON…$
MAXIE: GROUDON…\pNothing could awaken you from your\nsleep bathed in magma…\pThis BLUE ORB is what you sought.\nWasn't it?\pI have brought you the BLUE ORB.\nLet its shine awaken you!\pAnd show me…\nShow me the full extent of your power!$
MAXIE: GROUDON!\nWhat's wrong?\pWasn't the BLUE ORB the key?\pGROUDON!\nWhere have you gone…$
MAXIE: Oh, so it was you?\pI've seen you poking around uninvited\nhere and there…\pI get it now!\nYou must have pulled a cheap stunt!$
What makes you so adept at handling\nPOKéMON?$
MAXIE: There has to be some reason\nwhy GROUDON fled…\pThat's what you're trying to say,\naren't you?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pHumph…\nYou think I didn't know that?\pWith GROUDON gone, there is no longer\nany need for this blasted volcano.\pI am going after GROUDON, so this\nis where we part!$
UNCLE: It's because of POKéMON that\nthis boy's got more pep, I suppose…\lBut he's become a bit too peppy…$
WALLY: Aww, UNCLE, please?\pI want to challenge this GYM and see\nhow much better I've become.\pPlease? May I, please?$
UNCLE: Now hold on, WALLY.\pSince you started living with POKéMON,\nyou have grown quite a lot stronger.\pBut don't you think you're pushing it\nto suddenly challenge a GYM?$
WALLY: I'm not pushing it.\pIf I combine forces with RALTS,\nwe can beat anyone!$
WALLY: Oh! Hi, {PLAYER}!\pI've gotten a lot stronger since\nwe met.\p{PLAYER}, I want you and my UNCLE to\nunderstand that.\p{PLAYER}, please, will you have\na battle with me?$
WALLY: Oh… If you won't battle me,\n{PLAYER}, my UNCLE won't know that I've\lbecome really strong.$
UNCLE: {PLAYER}{KUN}, was it?\nOn WALLY's behalf, can I ask you to\lbattle with him just this once?\pI don't think he's going to listen to\nany reason the way he is now.$

WALLY: … … … … … … …\p… … … … … … … …\pI lost…$
WALLY: UNCLE…\nI'll go back to VERDANTURF…$
{PLAYER}, thank you.\nBeing a TRAINER is tough, isn't it?\pIt's not enough just to have POKéMON\nand make them battle. That isn't what\lbeing a real TRAINER is about.$
UNCLE: WALLY, there's no need to be so\ndown on yourself.\pWhy, what's keeping you from becoming\nstronger and stronger?\pCome on, let's go home.\nEveryone's waiting for you.$
UNCLE: {PLAYER}{KUN}, it just dawned on me\nthat you must be the TRAINER who kept\lan eye out for WALLY when he caught\lhis POKéMON.\pWhy don't you visit us in VERDANTURF\nsometime?\lI'm sure WALLY would enjoy it.$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … Beep!\pWALLY: Oh, hello, {PLAYER}!\pI just wanted to tell you that\nmy uncle bought me a POKéNAV!\pNow I can get in touch with you\nanytime, {PLAYER}!\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … Click!$

WATTSON: Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nYou look like you have a lot of zip!\lThat's a good thing, wahahahaha!\pFine!

It's getting unsafe.\pHere, this is the KEY to get into\nNEW MAUVILLE.$
WATTSON: Don't you worry about it.\nIt won't be a challenge to you.\pThe entrance to NEW MAUVILLE is just\na short SURF away from ROUTE 110.\pThat's it, then, you have my trust!\nWahahahaha!$
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\pI knew it, {PLAYER}{KUN}! I knew I'd made\nthe right choice asking you!\pThis is my thanks--a TM containing\nTHUNDERBOLT!\pGo on, you've earned it!$
WATTSON: Wahahahaha!\pIt pleases me to no end to see\nthe young step up and take charge!$
You know, it's cool to have POKéMON\nbattles and stuff…\pBut if your POKéMON gets hurt,\nyou have to nurse it back to health.$

I'm learning about BIKES while\nI work here.\pIf you need advice on how to ride your\nBIKE, there're a couple handbooks in\lthe back.$

A BIKE moves in the direction that\nthe + Control Pad is pressed.\pIt will speed up once it gets rolling.\pTo stop, release the + Control Pad.\nThe BIKE will slow to a stop.\pWant to read a different page?$
A MACH BIKE is speedy, but it can't\nstop very quickly.\pIt gets a little tricky to get around\na corner.\pRelease the + Control Pad a little\nbefore the corner and slow down.\pWant to read a different page?$

This is MAUVILLE GAME CORNER.$
Okay, you wanted some COINS for\nthe games?\pBut you don't have a COIN CASE for\nstowing the COINS.$
Were you looking for COINS?\pIt's ¥1000 for 50 COINS.\nWould you like some?$
Thank you very much!\nHere are your COINS!$
Um… You don't appear to have\nenough money…$
Oh?\nYour COIN CASE is full.$
Oh… You don't need COINS, then?\nGood luck on your adventure!$
Welcome.\pYou can exchange your COINS for\nprizes here.$
Which prize would you like?$
So your choice is\nthe {STR_VAR_1} {STR_VAR_2}?$
Thank you!\nWe'll send it to your PC at home.$
You don't have enough COINS.$
There isn't any room available for\nplacing {STR_VAR_1}.$
Oh, is that so? \nYou need to save some COINS before\lcoming back here.$
So your choice is {STR_VAR_1}?$
Here you go!$
Oh, you can't carry any more than that.$
I made a mistake and got two of\nthe same DOLLS.\pWould you like one of them?$
Here you go!$
Huh?\nYou want it, but not right now?$
Oh, don't be so negative!\nYou can have this!$
There's a prize I want, but I can't win\nthe jackpot.$
Hey, kid, if you want to play here,\nyou need a COIN CASE.\pI think the young lady next door\nhad one. Go see her!$
My luck can only last so long.\nThis is too much for me.\lHere, take some COINS!$
MAUVILLE has something for\neveryone.\pFor me, it's the GAME CORNER.$
The ROULETTE tables have different\nrates.\pCheck your COINS if you're going to\npick a table.$
It's easy to lose track of time in here. \nI should get back to work.$
COINS are needed to play here\nin the GAME CORNER.$
This ROULETTE thing…\nIt's rather demanding.\pWin or lose, it's only by luck.$
Up to three COINS can be used to play\nthe SLOTS.$
It's very difficult to make it stop\nright on “7.”\pIf it stops on “7” during the REEL TIME\nbonus game, you'll receive extra COINS.$
Here's some information for you\nabout the SLOTS.\pThe more lightning bolts you stock,\nthe more REEL TIME chances you get.\pIn a game with the maximum five\nREEL TIME chances…\pIt is possible to receive four regular\nbonuses, then a big bonus.\pThat would total 660 COINS, but it's\nvery difficult to get.$
You can't play if you don't have\na COIN CASE.$
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound {PLAYER}?\pWATTSON, the LEADER of MAUVILLE\nGYM, uses ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.\pIf you challenge him with WATER-type\nPOKéMON, he'll zap them! Bzzt!\pAnd, he's put in switch-controlled\ndoors all over his GYM! Eccentric!\pHey, go for it!$
Whoa, you're electrifying!\nYou've powered the door open!$
My electric soul, it'll shatter your\ndreams whole, whoa-yeahah!$
That was plugged in, amped up,\nover-driven electric, man!$
POKéMON and rock, it's all about heart,\nwhoa-yeah!$
I trained under WATTSON!\nThere ain't no way I'll lose easily!$
Unplugged and turned off…$
WATTSON, our GYM LEADER, has been\naround for a long, long time.\pHe was battling even before your\ndaddy was born, that tough coot.$
This GYM's got puzzles!\nIsn't it fun?$
It's no fun to lose…$
WATTSON says he likes setting up\nlittle traps with switches.$
With my charm and my POKéMON's moves,\nyou'll be shocked!$
I'm shocked by your power!$
I've heard that MAUVILLE was founded\nby WATTSON.\pHe was a TRAINER long before we\nbecame TRAINERS.\lHe must know all sorts of things!$
I love shiny things!$
Oh…\nMy eyes are frazzled…$
MAUVILLE GYM's WATTSON has a shiny\nforehead. It makes me happy!$
I've given up on my plans to convert\nthe city, I have.\pAnd so, I put my time into making\ndoor traps in my GYM.\pOh? Now, what are you doing here?\pWhat's that? You say you've gotten\npast all my rigged doors?\pWahahahah!\nNow, that is amusing!\pThen, I, WATTSON, the LEADER of\nMAUVILLE GYM, shall electrify you!$
Wahahahah!\nFine, I lost!\pYou ended up giving me a thrill!\nTake this BADGE!$
{PLAYER} received the DYNAMO BADGE\nfrom WATTSON.$
With the DYNAMO BADGE, POKéMON can\nuse ROCK SMASH out of battle.\pAnd, it will make your POKéMON a little\nbit faster, too.\pHmm…\nYou should take this, too!$
That TM34 there contains SHOCK WAVE.\pIt's a trustworthy move that never\nmisses! You can count on it!\p… … … … … …$
Registered GYM LEADER WATTSON\nin the POKéNAV.$
I swell with optimism, seeing a promising\nyoung TRAINER like you!$

MAUVILLE CITY POKéMON GYM\pWATTSON'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n{PLAYER}$
WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\lYou want to battle my POKéMON!\pWahahahaha!\pI'll make sparks fly from you!\nDon't say I didn't warn you!$
Oof…\nOur batteries ran dry…$
WATTSON: We'll have to recharge our\nbatteries again.\pWhen we're fully charged up, we'll\ngladly accept your challenge.\pSo, come back again sometime,\nwon't you?$
WATTSON: Ah-ha! Here at last!\nI know what you want.\lYou want to battle my POKéMON!\pWahahahaha!\pOops! Wait!\nYou've only one POKéMON with you!\pCome see me with two or more\nPOKéMON, all right?$
Woohoo!\pI hear people call me the ROCK SMASH\nGUY, but I find that sort of degrading.\pI think I deserve a bit more respect,\nlike maybe the ROCK SMASH DUDE.\pWoohoo!\pAnyways, your POKéMON look pretty\nstrong.\pI like that!\nHere, take this HIDDEN MACHINE!$
That HM contains ROCK SMASH.\pIf you come across large boulders\nthat block your path…\pWell, use that HM move and smash\nthem right out of your way!\pYes, sir! Smash rocks aside, I say!\nWoohoo!$
Oh, yes, if you smash a rock, a POKéMON\ncould come flying out of hiding.\pWoohoo!$
If I had a BIKE, it'd be easy to cycle to\nSLATEPORT for some shopping.\pI'd be able to buy HARBOR MAIL at the\nPOKéMON MART in SLATEPORT…$
Oh! You have HARBOR MAIL?\nWill you trade it for a COIN CASE?$
Oh, I'm so happy!\nOkay, I'll trade you a COIN CASE!$
That COIN CASE can be used\nat the GAME CORNER.$
Oh, that's disappointing.\pA COIN CASE is needed for the\nGAME CORNER.$
There are items that temporarily\nelevate the stats of POKéMON.\pThe ones I know you use in battle\nare X ATTACK and X DEFEND…\pI do believe that there are others\nlike them.$
Use a certain move, or use an item\ninstead…\pThe TRAINER's decisions determine how\nbattles turn out, I think.$
That man over there, he says weird\nthings!\pHe's funny in a weird way.\nI doubt I'll forget about him!$
When I accessed the RECORD CORNER,\nthe data for what's hot in DEWFORD\lgot updated.\pNow that bit of data is the same\nas my friend's!$
A RECORD CORNER opened upstairs in\nthe POKéMON CENTER.\pI don't know what it's about, but it\nsounds fun. I'll go check it out!$
Did you know that you can link battle\nat the COLOSSEUM here?\pThey put up your record on the wall\nfor everyone to see.\pIt's embarrassing if you lose more\noften than you win…$
Hehehe!\pWith this METEORITE, that thing in\nMT. CHIMNEY will…$
Heh?\pI don't know who you are, but if you get\nin the way of TEAM MAGMA, don't\lexpect any mercy!$
Hold it right there, TEAM MAGMA!\pYou're badly mistaken if you think you\ncan have your way with the world!$
Hehehe!\nEven TEAM AQUA joins us!\pBut it's too much trouble to deal with\nyou all…\pHeh, it doesn't matter!\pWe've got the METEORITE, so off to\nMT. CHIMNEY we go!\pHehehe! Be seeing you, you TEAM\nAQUA dingbats!$
ARCHIE: Didn't I see you before?\nAt SLATEPORT's MUSEUM?\pAh, so your name is {PLAYER}.\pAt the time, I thought you were one\nof TEAM MAGMA's goons.\pHumph…\nYou're one odd kid.\pTEAM MAGMA is a dangerous group of\ntotal fanatics.\pThey engage in destruction, claiming\nto expand the land mass.\pThey are the rivals to us,\nthe sea-loving TEAM AQUA!$
BOSS, we should give chase to\nTEAM MAGMA…$
ARCHIE: Yes, yes, we must!\nWe've got to hurry.\pThere's no telling what TEAM MAGMA\nwill do at MT. CHIMNEY!$
ARCHIE: {PLAYER}, you should keep\nan eye out for TEAM MAGMA, too.\pFarewell!$
I… I'm COZMO…\nI'm a PROFESSOR…\pTEAM MAGMA asked me to guide them\nto METEOR FALLS…\pBut they tricked me.\nThey even took my METEORITE away…\pAnd then another similar bunch,\nTEAM AQUA showed up.\pAfter that…\nI don't understand any of it.\pBut that TEAM MAGMA…\pWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?$
PROF. COZMO: But that TEAM MAGMA…\pWhat are they going to do with that\nMETEORITE at MT. CHIMNEY?$
This is where we DRAGON users do our\ntraining.\pThe CHAMPION even visits.\nNow do you see how special it is here?$
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!$
The road ahead remains long and harsh.\pWhen will my POKéMON and I become\nthe best?$
I want to know more about your power.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.$
Since we met, we have trained hard\nwith our sights on number one.\pHelp us see how much stronger we've\nbecome!$
Urgh!\nI didn't expect you to be so strong!$
You've obviously kept up your\nPOKéMON training.\pSo long as you remain strong, I, too,\ncan become stronger!$
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\lWe've confidence in ourselves.$
JOHN: Oh, my.\nWe've lost, dear wife.$
JOHN: We've been married for\nfifty years.\pCome to think of it, I've yet to beat\nmy dear wife in a battle.$

JOHN: Young TRAINER, if the chance\narises, will you battle with us again?$
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\pThe bond we share as a couple could\nnever be broken.$
JAY: Oh, dear.\nWe've lost, my dear husband.$
JAY: Fifty years of marriage…\pIf we ever argued, we always settled\nit with a POKéMON battle…$
JAY: Well, well, aren't you a young\nTRAINER?\pIf you'd care to battle with us, you'll\nhave to come back with more POKéMON.$
JOHN: We've always battled POKéMON\ntogether as a twosome.\lWe've confidence in ourselves.$

JOHN: Married for fifty years…\pOn reflection, the dear wife and I,\nwe battled day in and day out…$
JOHN: Well, well, what a young TRAINER!\pWill you battle with us? If so, you'll\nhave to return with more POKéMON.$
JAY: We've been married for\nfifty years.\pWe've supported each other all that\ntime. We've made ourselves strong.$

STEVEN: Oh, wow, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\nI'm amazed you knew where to find me.\pDo you, uh…maybe think of me as\njust a rock maniac?\pNo, that can't be right.\pWe battled alongside each other at\nthe SOOTOPOLIS SPACE CENTER.\pYou should have a very good idea\nabout how good I am.\pOkay, {PLAYER}{KUN}, if you're going to mount\na serious challenge, expect the worst!$
You…\nI had no idea you'd become so strong…$
STEVEN: Come to think of it, ever since\nour paths first crossed in GRANITE\lCAVE in DEWFORD, I had this feeling.\pI thought that you would eventually\nbecome the CHAMPION.\pMy predictions usually come true.\pAnd where will you go from here?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pFufufu, even I couldn't tell you that.$
You found the ROOT FOSSIL.\pIf this FOSSIL is taken, the ground\naround it will likely crumble away…\pTake the ROOT FOSSIL anyway?$
{PLAYER} left the ROOT FOSSIL alone.$
You found the CLAW FOSSIL.\pIf this FOSSIL is taken, the ground\naround it will likely crumble away…\pTake the CLAW FOSSIL anyway?$
{PLAYER} left the CLAW FOSSIL alone.$
I got this from STEVEN, but I don't\nknow what it's good for.\pI think it's called KING'S ROCK.\nDo you want it?$
Why would you want it?\nYou're weird.\pYou can keep it, but keep it a secret\nfrom STEVEN.$
STEVEN's house is right over there!$
Yeah, you think so, too! What are you\nsupposed to do with some weird rock?$
Around MOSSDEEP, you can see wild\nWAILMER.\pIt's called, uh…\nWhat was it now…\pWAI, WAI, WAI…\pWAILMER watching!$
The island's SPACE CENTER has been\nlaunching huge rockets.\pThere's been some kind of an uproar\nover a letter they received recently.$
The island's SPACE CENTER has been\nlaunching huge rockets.$
I heard from a SAILOR buddy that\nTEAM AQUA set up shop in LILYCOVE.\pI also heard that someone came along\nand wiped the floor with them!\pBut MOSSDEEP here's been targeted\nby that TEAM MAGMA.\pIf you want to know what they're up to,\ngo visit the SPACE CENTER.$
I'm a SAILOR, so the sea's obviously\nmore important to me.\pBut you know? When I get back on land\nafter a long voyage, I do feel relief!$
Wouldn't it be nice?\pIf the whole world was covered in\nplants and flowers like this island?$
All life needs the sea to live, even\nthough it makes its home on the land.\pLife, having run its course, becomes\nsoil and returns to the land.\pAnd the sea is always connected to\nthe land.\pYes, like the very shoreline here.$
A voyage on a ship is fine.\pBut crossing the sea with POKéMON\nusing SURF…\pNow that's an exhilarating trip!\nWouldn't you agree, youngster?$
This rock has a special meaning to\nthe people at the SPACE CENTER.\pThey put it here as their wish for\ntheir rockets to fly safely.\pWhen you make a wish, what do you use?\nDo you wish upon a star?\pI use a wish tag to make it happen.\nThat's what I do.$
It's a white rock.$

SCOTT: {PLAYER}{KUN}, feeling good?\nI'm doing great!\pI'd heard MOSSDEEP's GYM LEADER is\npretty strong, so I decided to come\ltake a look-see for myself.\pBut there's something wrong about\nthis town.\pPeople are going on about a warning\nletter and the SPACE CENTER…\pI don't think it concerns me in any\nway, though.$
Ahh… It feels great letting the waves\nwash over my feet…\pSpeaking of the waves, you know that\nisland city SOOTOPOLIS?\pI think the GYM there had a new\nLEADER come in.\pPeople tell me the new LEADER once\nmentored WALLACE.$
When I was young, I traveled the world\nas a POKéMON TRAINER.\pNow that I've become an old buzzard,\nmy only amusement is watching young\lTRAINERS battle.$
The door appears to be locked.$
A TRAINER named {STR_VAR_1} is\nvisiting my home.\pWould you like to challenge\n{STR_VAR_1}?$
You won't battle? I'm disappointed\nthat I can't see you battle…$
Oh, good, good!\pBut my house isn't all that sturdy.\pCould I ask you to keep it down to\na 3-on-3 match?$
Before you two battle, you should\nsave your progress.$
I hope to see a good match!$
So, it became a standoff.\pIt was a brilliant match in which\nneither side conceded a step!$
That was superlative!\pWhy, it was like seeing myself in\nmy youth again!$
Ah, too bad for you!\pBut it was a good match.\nI hope you can win next time.$
Yo, how's it going, CHAMPION-bound\n{PLAYER}?\pThe GYM LEADERS here use\nPSYCHIC-type POKéMON.\pIf you go up against them with\nFIGHTING- or POISON-type POKéMON,\lthey'll inflict horrible damage!\pPlus, they'll come at you with\noutstanding combination attacks.\pIf you want to win, you'll need to show\nthem how tight you are with your\lPOKéMON. Go for it!$
Wow, you're astounding!\nYou're one great TRAINER!$
Battles hinge on the strength of your\nspirit! The weak-spirited will never win!$
I lost!\nI must temper my spirit again!$
The indecisive lose.\nThat's my warning to you.$
Let me see your talent!$
You possess spectacular talent!$
If there are prodigies in the world,\nthen our GYM LEADERS are them!\pHowever, you may be even more talented\nthan them…$
Fufufufu… Watch me levitate a POKé\nBALL telekinetically!\pWrooooooooaaaar!\n… … … … … … …\pSometimes, I'm out of sync…$
My POKéMON battling skills are out\nof sync, too!$
A POKé BALL was too heavy to lift\npsychically. But this dust bunny…\pWhoooooooooooooooh!\n… … … … … …\pNo, I'm not cheating!\nI didn't blow on it! Honestly!$
When you lose to me, don't be too hard\non yourself.\pIt's not that you're weak--I'm just\ntoo strong!$
You're just too strong!$
I'm not going to get down on myself for\nlosing. I just need to train harder.\pPositive thinking--that's my strong\npoint!$
I see it…\nI see your future…\pIf you can beat me, I will tell you\nyour future!$
I surrender!$
You will wage a terrifically intense\nbattle with our GYM LEADERS…\pThe result…\nYou won't hear it from me!$
The roads you have traveled…\nWhat you have experienced…\pCome at me with everything you've\nlearned!$
You've traveled a path of greatness!$
A bright future awaits those who have\nworked diligently.\pFor those who lazed idly, there is\nonly despair at the end.\pWhat goes around comes around…$
Even at the risk of life, I will win\nthis battle!$
What you do…\nIt horrifies me…$
How dare you beat me…\pIt won't be my fault if something\nhorrible befalls you…$
Hohoho.\pYou need me to show you how tenacious\nthe PSYCHIC type can be.$
Oh! My, my!\nYour battle style is fantastic!$
I… I don't let defeat rattle m-me,\nhowever b-badly.$
Let me show you a perfectly awful,\nhorrifying time!$
N-nooooo!$
Your vitality is contagious!\nGet away from me quickly!$
I may be past my prime, but I suggest\nyou not patronize me.$
Ah, you overflow with the power\nof youth!$
It seems that I could not overcome\nyour youthful energy.$
You're not getting through to the end!\nNot if I can help it!$
How could you be so ludicrously\nstrong?$
Humph! You may be strong, but you're\nnot suitable for the PSYCHIC type!\pThe way you battle is somehow brutal!$
Wroooar! Have a taste of my super\nPOKéMON hard-battling power!$
Oh!\nDone in!$
All right! I think I'll develop a special\ninvincible POKéMON power next.$

We are doing fine.\p“We will soon visit you to take your\nrocket fuel.\p“Please don't try to stop us.\nWe will take the fuel no matter what.\p“Let there be more land!\n                                          TEAM MAGMA”$
MOSSDEEP has mainly sunny weather,\nand its winds are stable.\pIt's an ideal location for launching\nrockets.$
Why would TEAM MAGMA want to steal\nour rocket fuel in the first place?$
If only I was a little younger, I would\nhave liked being an astronaut…\pNo… It's not too late!\nI can and will try!$
If TEAM MAGMA takes the rocket fuel,\nI won't be able to go to space!\pThey can't be allowed to get away\nwith such an outrage!$
I wish ordinary people could go into\nspace one day…$
TEAM MAGMA…\nDo they want to go to space, too?$
What's wrong with you?\pYou're outnumbered three to one,\nbut you still want to take us on?$
Good answer!\nThat's what a smart person'll do!$
A reckless go-getter, are you?\nOkay, I'll go first!$
I lost!\nBut!$
It's too soon to be relieved!\nI'm up next!$
I lost, too!\nBut!$
I bet you want to take a break.\nBut I'm not about to let you do that!$
We should've taken a break…\nThat's what we should've done…$
Three of us here, and look at the sorry\nmess we got ourselves into.$
We three losing like this…\nWe look worse than usual by triple!$
Are we being useful to our leader\nat all?$
Hehehe!\pWe come all the way here to get some\nfuel, and we're interfered with again!\pIf you're going to mess with us too,\nwe'll take care of you at the same time!$
MAXIE: Clear out of the way!\nDon't you dare interfere!$
STEVEN: TEAM MAGMA…\pWhat's the point of stealing rocket\nfuel?$
MAXIE: Fufufu… Since you're so\ncurious, you deserve an explanation.\pWe're going to jettison the entire\nload into MT. CHIMNEY!\pWith GROUDON gone, we have no need\nfor that slag heap of a mountain!\pSo we'll use the fuel's power to make\nthe volcano erupt!\pIt will be savage!$
STEVEN: {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nYou're going to help me?\pLet's go into battle together!\nAre you ready?$
STEVEN: Then, hurry!\nGet ready quickly!$
All I want…\nI just want to expand the land mass…$
I'm with our leader…$
MAXIE: We failed to make the volcano\nerupt…\pWe failed to control GROUDON after\nwe had awoken it…\pIs our goal to expand the land\nmisguided?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pIf…\nIf we, TEAM MAGMA, are wrong…\l… … … … … …\pThen might TEAM AQUA's goal to expand\nthe sea also be equally misguided?$
MAXIE: All right…\nWe will give up on the fuel…\pThere appear to be more important\nmatters that I must examine…$
STEVEN: Whew, that was too tense.\n{PLAYER}{KUN}, thank you.\pI have something to give you as\nthanks for your support.\pPlease come see me at home\nafter this.\pOh, yes, I don't live in RUSTBORO CITY.\nI live right here on this island.$
STEVEN: {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pAs you can see, there's not much here,\nbut this is my home.\pThank you for all that you've done.\pThis is my token of appreciation.\nIt's the HIDDEN MACHINE DIVE.\pNo need to be shy--you've earned\nthis HM.$
STEVEN: While you're using SURF, you\nshould notice dark patches of water.\pUse DIVE if you come to deep water\nlike it. You'll drop to the seafloor.\pWhen you want to come back up, use\nDIVE again.\pIn some places, it won't be possible\nfor you to surface, though.$
STEVEN: Apparently, there's an\nunderwater cavern between\lMOSSDEEP and SOOTOPOLIS.\pYou know, the one that CAPT. STERN\nfound in his submarine.$
{PLAYER} checked the POKé BALL.\pIt contained the POKéMON\nBELDUM.\pTake the POKé BALL?$
{PLAYER} obtained a BELDUM.$
There is no space for another POKéMON.$
{PLAYER} left the POKé BALL where\nit was.$
It's a letter.\p… … … … … …\pTo {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pI've decided to do a little soul-\nsearching and train on the road.\pI don't plan to return home for some\ntime.\pI have a favor to ask of you.\pI want you to take the POKé BALL on\nthe desk.\pInside it is a BELDUM, my favorite\nPOKéMON.\pI'm counting on you.\pMay our paths cross someday.\pSTEVEN STONE$
It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by STEVEN.$
The power contained in the METEORITE…\pBy amplifying its power with this\nmachine, MT. CHIMNEY's volcanic\lactivity will instantly intensify…\pIts energy will grow deep inside\nthe crater and…\lFufufu…$
MAXIE: Hm?\nWho are you?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pI'd heard ARCHIE bemoaning a child\nwho's been meddling in TEAM AQUA's\laffairs.\pIt must be you he meant.\pHumph! So you're thinking of\ninterfering with us, TEAM MAGMA?\pNow you listen.\nLong ago, living things used the\lland to live and grow.\pThat is why land is all important!\nIt is the cradle of all!\pThat is why TEAM MAGMA is dedicated\nto the expansion of the land mass.\pIt is for further advancement of\nhumankind and POKéMON!\pAnd for that, we need the power of\nwhat sleeps within this mountain…\pOh! There was no need for you to\nlearn that much.\pBut, no matter!\nI'll teach you the consequences of\lmeddling in our grand design!$
What?!\pI, MAXIE, was caught off guard?!$
MAXIE: But, enough.\nI will back off this time.\pBut don't think that this is the last\nyou've seen of TEAM MAGMA.\pFufufu…\pEven without the METEORITE, if we\nobtain that ORB… Fufufu…$
Hehehe!\pSo you've come all the way here!\pBut you're too late!\nI've already delivered the METEORITE\lfrom METEOR FALLS to the BOSS!$
Hehehe…\pEven though I've lost, if our leader\nawakens that thing…$
BOSS, hurry!\nGive it the METEORITE's energy!\pHehehe…$
We of TEAM MAGMA are working hard for\neveryone's sake.\pLike, if that thing's power made more\nland, there'd be more places to live.\pEveryone'd be happy!$
Hunh?\nWhat do you mean I lost?$
Our BOSS says, “It will make everyone\nhappy.”\pBut why does everyone keep getting\nin our way?$
If there were more land, I'd be able\nto get a big house of my own!\pI'm going to build it on hardened lava!$
My dream of a big house…$
A kid like you, you ought to be\nsplashing about in the waves!$
That annoying TEAM AQUA…\nThey always mess with our plans!$
METEORITES pack amazing power!$
You'd better not mess with us!\pWe're trying to awaken that thing\nfor the benefit of everyone!$
We're TEAM MAGMA!\pThey're TEAM AQUA!\pIt totally annoys me that they'd\nuse a name like ours!$
Yeah!\nDouse them in fire!$
We're going to keep making more land!$
Bufoh!$
ARCHIE: Grr, {PLAYER}!\nI should've guessed you'd show up!\pSee for yourself what the fanatics\nof TEAM MAGMA are up to!\pThey're trying to inject the stolen\nMETEORITE's power into the volcano!\pDoing something like that will cause\nthe volcano's eruption!$
ARCHIE: Grrr…\pI want to stop that MAXIE,\nbut I can't!\pNot when I have my hands full battling\nthree opponents at once!$
ARCHIE: {PLAYER}!\nThank you!\pWith your help, we thwarted TEAM\nMAGMA's destructive plan!\pBut… You…\nWhose side are you on?\pAh, it doesn't matter.\pWe will remain vigilant and keep up\nour pursuit of TEAM MAGMA.\p{PLAYER}, we shall meet again!$
Darn… TEAM MAGMA outnumbers us!\nWe can't keep up with them!$
If they expand the land, there'll be\nless habitats for WATER POKéMON!$
We're TEAM AQUA!\pThey're TEAM MAGMA!\pIt burns me up that they'd use such\na confusing name!$
Bushaa!$

I've been to the hot springs and\nrefreshed my tired bones.\lRight now I'm feeling strong!$
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!$
Well, well, I've lost. I can't call\nmyself an EXPERT now, can I?$
Thank you, child. It was fun, as if\nI were battling my own grandchild.\pPlease, come see me again for\na rematch.$
If you can mesh your heart with those\nof your POKéMON, why, you should be\lable to achieve great things.$
Oh, my goodness.\nNow, aren't you something!$
Perhaps your heart has become one\nwith the hearts of your POKéMON.$
I've got the fire in me, baby.\nI can't stand it! I have to battle!$
Ooh, that was a scorching-hot match!$
The heat of MT. CHIMNEY warms\nme up, baby!$
I've finally made it to MT. CHIMNEY.\nI want to make my POKéMON battle!$
The way you battle…\nIt's like a MT. CHIMNEY eruption!$
Like I said, I've finally made it to\nMT. CHIMNEY. It would be a shame if\lI only do a little sightseeing…\pI want to get in some battles and buy\nCOOKIES as souvenirs.$
Since I bathed in the hot springs,\nI've been feeling great!\lI'm sure I'm going to win!$
Yowch!\nI'm getting a chill out of the water.$
I'll have to take another dip in the\nhot springs. Want to join me?\pJust joking!$
This is one fine mountain! Plenty of\nhot people around for company!$
Oh, you're a real firebrand, too!$
I think I need a dip in LAVARIDGE\nHOT SPRING with the locals!$
I like little fireballs like you.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.$
I'm happily surrounded by hot people\naround these parts. I won't lose!$
Gosh, you're still the same\nfirebrand as before!$
Actually, it really is hot here.\nI'm overdressed for these parts.$
The CABLE CAR is ready to go down.\nWould you like to be on it?$
Please step this way.$
Please ride with us another time.$
All sorts of beings wander the slopes\nof MT. PYRE…\pThere is no telling what may happen.\nTake this. It's for your own good.$

Did you come to pay your respect\nto the spirits of departed POKéMON?\pYou must care for your POKéMON a lot.$
This is the final resting place of my\nZIGZAGOON. I cherished it…$
Memories of my darling SKITTY…\nMy eyes overflow thinking about it.$
Ooch, ouch… There are holes in the\nground here and there.\pI didn't notice and took a tumble from\nthe floor above.$
Hey! Are you searching for POKéMON?\nYou came along after me! You're rude!$
Ayieeeeh!\nI'm sorry, forgive me, please!$
People don't come here often, so\nI thought there'd be rare POKéMON.$
LUKE: We're here on a dare.\pHeheh, if I show her how cool I am,\nshe'll fall for me. I know it!\pI know! I'll cream you and show her\nhow cool I am!$
LUKE: Whoopsie!$
LUKE: Well, we lost but that's okay!\nI'm right here by your side.\lWe'll make it through this dare!$
LUKE: If you want to take me on,\nbring some more POKéMON.\pIf you don't, I won't be able to show\noff to my girl how cool I am!$
DEZ: I came here on a dare with my\nboyfriend.\pIt's really scary, but I'm with my\nboyfriend. It's okay.\pI know! I'll get my boyfriend to look\ncool by beating you!$
DEZ: Waaaah! I'm scared!$
DEZ: We're lovey-dovey, so we don't\ncare if we lose!$
DEZ: If you want to challenge us, you\nshould bring at least two POKéMON.\pMy boyfriend's strong.\nJust one POKéMON won't do at all.$
You are an unfamiliar sight…\nDepart before anything befalls you!$
Hmm…\nYou're durable.$
Our family has been TRAINERS here\nsince my great-grandmother's time…\pIt is my duty to protect this\nmountain…$
Kiyaaaaah!\nI'm terrified!$
Nooooooo!\nI lost my wits!$
I get freaked out every time I see\nanything move…\pI shouldn't have come here to train…$
The rich atmosphere of the mountain\nhas elevated my psychic power!\pA mere child like you…\nYou dream of winning?$
I drown in self-pity…$
My psychic powers have surely\ngrown several times, but…$
Ahahahaha!\pThis is no place for children, least\nof all you!$
I lost that cleanly…$
This means my training is still not\nenough…\pI've got to keep working toward the\nsummit…\pGo, me!$
Why have you come here?$
That was amazing!\nYou're a very special TRAINER.$
POKéMON no longer of this world.\nPOKéMON that are with you now.\pAnd the POKéMON that you will meet\nin the future…\pThey are all to be equally cherished.\nPlease remember that.$
I would like to see your POKéMON\nwhen they grow up some more…\pPlease, I need to see your POKéNAV.$
Oh, it's you…\pHave you come to show me your grown\nPOKéMON?$
How amazing!\nYou are a special person.$
POKéMON no longer of this world.\nPOKéMON that are with you now.\pAnd the POKéMON that you will meet\nin the future…\pThey are all to be equally cherished.\nI see that you've remembered that.$
Teacher…\nPlease watch over my progress!$
Teacher…\nPlease forgive me!$
Until I improve, my teacher, who rests\nhere, will never find true peace…$
I love all things horrifying…\nIt's like a disease…\pWhen I'm here…\nI shiver with fear…$
Losing, I dislike…$
I want to see dreadful things…\nI can't leave…\pStay…\nWon't you stay with me?$
When I'm here…\nA curious power flows into me…$
The power is ebbing away…$
Perhaps the power is from the spirits\nof POKéMON in fitful sleep here…$
Fufufu… I lost the match, but…\nI have this little ability…\pWithout ever laying my hands on\nyour POKéNAV… Hiyah!$
Behind you…\nWhat is it…$
Something faded away…$
The POKéMON at rest here…\nSometimes, they play…$
Have you lost your bearings?\nHave no fear for I am here!$
Weren't you lost?$
I had this feeling that a lost TRAINER\nwould be panicked and easy to beat.\pIt's dirty and I won't try it again…$
No! Those TEAM MAGMA goons got\nhere ahead of us!\pWe can't fall behind!$
I thought you were one of the MAGMAS\nwho happened to come back…$
Yeah, so you are strong…\nBut there're a lot of us!$
Hah!\nToo bad for you!\pIf you came earlier, you only would've\nhad to battle the wimpy TEAM MAGMA.\pBut since you arrived now, you have\nto take on us toughies!$
Urgh… I should've let you take on\nTEAM MAGMA first…$
You don't know anything!\nSo why are you messing with us?$
You…\nWe saw you at MT. CHIMNEY.\pYou don't belong to either TEAM,\nso why would you be here?$
If you're going to mess with anyone,\nlet it be TEAM MAGMA…$
Heh, it doesn't matter!\nWe bought ourselves some time!\pThe BOSS should have snatched what\nhe was after!$
Oh, I know!\nYou tried to join TEAM MAGMA,\lbut they wouldn't have you!\pWell, don't think that we'll let you\njoin our TEAM AQUA!$
If you want to join TEAM AQUA that\nbadly, we can consider it…$
We have a great combination going\nwith us members and our leader.$
ARCHIE: TEAM MAGMA's MAXIE got ahead\nof us, but we also got what we wanted.\pThe RED ORB preserved at MT. PYRE…\nI, ARCHIE, now have it in my possession!\pFufufu… Now we can bring our ultimate\nobjective to fruition!\pOkay, TEAM!\nWe're pulling out!$
Oh, no…\nThis cannot happen…\pNot only the BLUE ORB, but even\nthe RED ORB has been taken…\pThe BLUE ORB and RED ORB must never\nbe separated. They belong together.\pWhat are those men trying to do with\nthe two ORBS?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pOh, yes. Was it TEAM MAGMA who came\nand took the BLUE ORB first?\pWell, in their haste, they left this\nbehind.\pI couldn't imagine what exactly it\ncould be.\pI would like you to have it.\nPerhaps it will be useful in some way.$
The BLUE ORB and RED ORB taken by\nthose sinister men…\pThey must never be apart…\nI fear something terrible will happen…$
Oh, my goodness…\pYou say that both GROUDON and KYOGRE\nhave been awakened?\pIt is said that the BLUE ORB and\nthe RED ORB quelled the rage of\lthe two POKéMON…\pIt is also said that the true owner\nof the ORBS still exists.\pHowever, no one knows who, or what\nexactly, the ORBS belong to.\pIt could be a human, or perhaps\na POKéMON, but no one knows.$
The two men who took the ORBS came\nback to return them on their own.\pThose men…\nPerhaps they are not so evil after all…$
The embodiments of the land, sea,\nand the sky…\pThat is said to be the identities of\nthe super-ancient POKéMON…\pIn the same way that we humans and\nPOKéMON have life, our world, too,\lis alive…\pThe super-ancient POKéMON have\ntaught us that…$
MT. PYRE is where we calm the spirits\nof POKéMON that have passed on…\pThis is a high place where one can\nsee all of HOENN…\pThe disembodied spirits of POKéMON\nmust find solace here…\pIs it coincidence that you are here…\pWill you hear out my tale? A tale long\ntold in the HOENN region?$
It happened long, long ago…\pThe world was wracked by a ferocious\nclash between the POKéMON of the land\land the POKéMON of the sea…\pThe POKéMON of the land raised\nmountains and created continents…\pThe POKéMON of the sea raised huge\nwaves and carved out oceans…\pTheir fierce duel raged without end.\pThe world was engulfed in massive\ninfernos and vicious storms.\pThe BLUE ORB and the RED ORB brought\nan end to the calamity.\pLight poured from the two ORBS and\nbecalmed the enraged adversaries.\pThe pair, made docile, dove deep into\nthe sea where eventually they\ldisappeared…$
I see…\nWell, that, too, is fine…$
MAXIE: {PLAYER}…\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …$
It is my role to pass on the legends\nof HOENN to future generations.\pAnd the crisis that just ended in\nSOOTOPOLIS rewrote a legend…\pHave you the time to hear the new\nlegend of HOENN?$

The door is locked.$
Use the BASEMENT KEY?$
{PLAYER} used the BASEMENT KEY.\pThe door opened!$
The generator is radiating heat that\ncan be felt even at a distance.\pIt looks like it should be turned off\nas soon as possible.$
The generator quieted down.$
{PLAYER} stepped on the switch.\pClick…\p… … … … … … … …\n… … … … … … … …\pThe generator appears to have\nstopped…$
I want to take a rest, so I'm saving my\nprogress.$
Hi!\nI work at a POKéMON MART.\pCan I get you to come with me?$
This is a POKéMON MART.\nJust look for our blue roof.\pWe sell a variety of goods including\nPOKé BALLS for catching POKéMON.\pHere, I'd like you to have this as\na promotional item.$
A POTION can be used anytime, so it's\neven more useful than a POKéMON CENTER\lin certain situations.$
Aaaaah! Wait!\nPlease don't come in here.\pI just discovered the footprints of\na rare POKéMON!\pWait until I finish sketching\nthem, okay?$
I just discovered the footprints of\na rare POKéMON!\pWait until I finish sketching\nthem, okay?$

OLDALE TOWN\n“Where things start off scarce.”$
When a POKéMON battle starts, the one\nat the left of the list goes out first.\pSo, when you get more POKéMON in your\nparty, try switching around the order\lof your POKéMON.\pIt could give you an advantage.$
When POKéMON battle, they eventually\nlevel up and become stronger.$
If the POKéMON with you become\nstronger, you'll be able to go farther\laway from here.$
The clerk says they're all sold out.\nI can't buy any POKé BALLS.$
I'm going to buy a bunch of POKé BALLS\nand catch a bunch of POKéMON!$
If a POKéMON gets hurt and loses its HP\nand faints, it won't be able to battle.\pTo prevent your POKéMON from fainting,\nrestore its HP with a POTION.$

“Six dots open three doors.”\pGrandpa used to say that, but I don't\nknow what he meant.$

Ah!\nYour POKéMON…$
It clearly likes you very much.\pA POKéMON that adoring and adorable\ndeserves a TM like this, no?$
Hmm…\nIt's not bad, but it's also not good.\pYou, as the TRAINER, need to put in\nsome more effort.$
It has a vicious look to it.\pA frightening POKéMON like that\ndeserves a TM like this.$
If a POKéMON likes you a lot, RETURN's\npower is enhanced.\pIf it doesn't like you, FRUSTRATION's\npower goes up.$
Oh, yes. In about {STR_VAR_1} or so days,\nI should be getting a good TM or two.\pYou should come see me then.\nI'll give you a TM that's suitable for\lyour POKéMON.$

No, no, no! I won't accept any\nless than a real {STR_VAR_1}!$

I know I could go looking for one\non my own, but…\pBut I really wanted to get a BAGON\nthat another TRAINER caught…$
Is that a POKéDEX?\pDid you get to meet a lot of different\nPOKéMON?\pI wish I was like you.$
People were saying they saw a POKéMON\nflying high above HOENN.\pIs it flying around all the time?\nDoesn't it need to rest somewhere?$
A sky POKéMON!\nA sky POKéMON!$
Where did you come from?$
Yes?\nYES TOWN?\pI've never heard of a place like that.$
No? That doesn't make any sense.\nYou have to come from somewhere.\pOh! Wait! You're not going to say you\nwere born at the bottom of the sea?$

WALLY: I'm going to go stay with my\nrelatives in VERDANTURF TOWN.\pI thought I would be lonely by myself,\nso I wanted to take a POKéMON along.\pBut I've never caught a POKéMON before.\nI don't know how…$
DAD: Hm. I see.$
DAD: {PLAYER}, you heard that,\nright?\pGo with WALLY and make sure that he\nsafely catches a POKéMON.$
WALLY, here, I'll loan you my POKéMON.\pWALLY received a ZIGZAGOON!$
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nA POKéMON!\pDAD: Hm. I'll give you a POKé BALL, too.\nGo for it!\pWALLY received a POKé BALL!$
WALLY: Oh, wow!\nThank you!$
{PLAYER}… Would you really come\nwith me?$
DAD: So, did it work out?$
WALLY: Thank you, yes, it did.\nHere's your POKéMON back.\p{PLAYER}, thank you for coming along\nwith me.\pYou two are why I was able to catch\nmy POKéMON.\pI promise I'll take really good\ncare of it.\pOh! My mom's waiting for me,\nso I have to go!\pBye, {PLAYER}!$
DAD: Now…\p{PLAYER}, if you want to become a\nstrong TRAINER, here's my advice.\pHead for RUSTBORO CITY beyond this\ntown.\pThere, you should challenge\nthe GYM LEADER, ROXANNE.\pAfter her, go on to other POKéMON\nGYMS and defeat their LEADERS.\pCollect BADGES from them,\nunderstood?\pOf course, I'm a GYM LEADER, too.\nWe'll battle one day, {PLAYER}.\pBut that's only after you become\nstronger.$
DAD: Hm? Aren't you going to the\nPOKéMON GYM in RUSTBORO CITY?\pThere's no challenge for me to\nbattle a greenhorn TRAINER.\p{PLAYER}, I want you to challenge me\nwhen you become a lot stronger.\pI'll battle you, {PLAYER}, when you\ncan show me four GYM BADGES, okay?$
DAD: I see… So, you've beaten\nthe GYM LEADER in RUSTBORO CITY.\pBut there are many more TRAINERS\nwho are stronger than you, {PLAYER}.\pAcross the sea in DEWFORD TOWN is a\nGYM LEADER named BRAWLY.\pYou should go challenge him.$
DAD: Hm… {PLAYER}, you have gotten\nstronger.\pI can tell by the number of BADGES\nthat you've earned.$
DAD: Hm…\nSo, you did get four GYM BADGES.\pFine, as I promised, we will have\na POKéMON battle.\p{PLAYER}…\pI'm so happy that I can have\na real battle with my own child.\pBut, a battle is a battle!\pI will do everything in my power as\na GYM LEADER to win.\p{PLAYER}, you'd better give it your\nbest shot, too!$
…\pI… I can't…\pI can't believe it. {PLAYER}…\pI lost to {PLAYER}?\pBut, rules are rules!\nHere, take this.$
{PLAYER} received the BALANCE BADGE\nfrom DAD!$
DAD: With that BADGE, the DEFENSE\nof all your POKéMON will increase.\pPOKéMON that know the HM move SURF\nwill be able to travel over water.\pThis is my gift to you. {PLAYER}, I'm\nsure you can use it correctly.$
DAD: TM42 contains FACADE.\pIt doubles the power of moves if\nthe POKéMON is poisoned, paralyzed,\lor burned.\pIt might be able to turn a bad\nsituation into an advantage.$
DAD: As the GYM LEADER, I can't\nexpress how upset I am…\pBut as a father, it makes me both\nhappy and a little sad. It's odd…$
Ah, there you are, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pPlease come with me.\nI have something I want you to have.$
NORMAN, you don't mind, do you?\pLet me borrow your {PLAYER}{KUN} for\na minute or two.$
DAD: {PLAYER}, you should go visit\nyour mother every so often.\pI'm going to stay here and redouble\nmy training.\pIt would bother me as a TRAINER to\nnot avenge my loss to you, {PLAYER}!$
DAD: {PLAYER}, how are things going?\pThe world of POKéMON is deep.\pI honestly think that no amount of\ntraining would ever be enough.$
Hey, how's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound {PLAYER}?\pThe doors in this GYM open when you\nbeat the awaiting TRAINERS.\pWhoops! The doors in this room are\nalready open, so don't attack me!\pThe TRAINERS of PETALBURG GYM\nuse all kinds of items.\pThe door at the left leads to\nthe SPEED ROOM.\pThe door at the right leads to\nthe ACCURACY ROOM.\pThe room's name will be on\nthe door, so choose carefully.\pOnce you've chosen the door…\nWell, hey, go for it!$
{PLAYER}! Whoa! You've overcome even\nyour own father!\pLike, whoa!\nWhat a stunning turn of events!$
The ability to attack before the\nopponent…\pJust that alone puts me at a great\nadvantage, don't you agree?$
That was a magnificent battle!$
Go on to the next room where a new\nchallenge awaits you.\pAt the left is the CONFUSION ROOM.\pThe right door leads to the DEFENSE\nROOM.$
Whomever you beat, and whomever you\nmay lose to, you never shirk from\ltraining yourself and your POKéMON.\pThat's what I think being a\nGYM LEADER is all about.$
This is the CONFUSION ROOM.\pLet me see how well bonded you are\nwith your POKéMON!$
I couldn't confuse your team enough…\nYou share a strong bond together.$
The next room is the STRENGTH ROOM.\nCan you withstand brute force?$
After you beat our LEADER, the\ntraining has become a lot tougher.$
Just when you think you're going to\nwin, your opponent restores HP…\pCan you just imagine how awful that\nmust feel?\pI'll show you exactly how awful it\nfeels!$
I couldn't restore HP enough…\nWhat ATTACK power…$
I should have expected no less from\nour LEADER's kid.\pNo, wait! A TRAINER's abilities are\nearned only through effort.\pI lost because my own efforts\nweren't enough.\pGo on! The ONE-HIT KO ROOM is next.$
I'm going to keep training at GYMS.\nOne day, I'll become a LEADER.$
I'm not going to take it easy just\nbecause you're our LEADER's kid.\pI'll show you how horrid it is for\na POKéMON to take a critical hit!$
Your power…\nYou're the real deal.$
Your father really is strong.\nHe's a TRAINER worth my respect.\pAnd, I sense the same glow coming\nfrom you as your father.\pI hope that you'll stage a terrific\nbattle with your father!$
Since your dad became the LEADER,\nthe TRAINERS of PETALBURG CITY have\lbecome a lot tougher.$
Giggle…\nThis is the ACCURACY ROOM.\pIt's pretty nasty when every attack\nlands without fail.$
You were a cut above me…$
There are some even stronger\nTRAINERS waiting for you.\pThe left is the DEFENSE ROOM, and\nthe right is the RECOVERY ROOM.\pYour POKéMON's ATTACK power will be\non trial either way.$
Do you know what we're trying to\nachieve as TRAINERS?\pWe're striving to become soul mates\nwith our POKéMON.$
The higher the DEFENSE, the more\nreckless I can be in attack.$
Our defenses weren't enough…$
I think you've taught me a valuable\nlesson here.\pNow, go on! The left door goes to\nthe STRENGTH ROOM.\pThe right door opens to\nthe ONE-HIT KO ROOM.\pBoth of them have TRAINERS who are\nskilled at offense.$
Hi! Have you tried using SURF?$
Our GYM LEADER told us to go all out\nand beat you.\pEven if you happen to be the\nLEADER's kid!$
But… I went all out!$
The way you use your POKéMON…\nIt's like your father's style.\pGo on through! The GYM LEADER, your\nfather, is waiting!$
Sure, it's fine to make your POKéMON\nstronger.\pBut what decides the winner?\pWhy, it's the feelings TRAINERS have\nfor their POKéMON.$
This door appears to be locked\nright now…$
“SPEED ROOM,” the sign says.\pDo you want to go through?$

DAD: {PLAYER}…\nI had a feeling that you would come.\pI would never refuse to accept\na challenge from you.\pYou do understand, don't you?\pInside a GYM, it doesn't matter that\nwe are a parent and child.\p…No, because we are parent and child,\nwe owe it to each other to do the best\lwe can. Isn't that right, {PLAYER}?$
Uh… Haha…\nMaybe that was going too hard…$
DAD: {PLAYER}…\nWhat is your dream?\pMy dream…\nHahaha…\lIt has already come true, actually.$
DAD: {PLAYER}…\nI had a feeling that you would come.\pI would never refuse to accept\na challenge from you.\pYou do understand, don't you?\pInside a GYM, it doesn't matter that\nwe are a parent and child.\pHm? Wait a second, {PLAYER}.\pDo you only have one POKéMON that is\ncapable of battle?\pSorry, but you'll have to come back\nwith at least two POKéMON.$
Traveling is wonderful!\pWhen I was young, I roamed the seas\nand the mountains!$
Sigh…\pI wish I could go on an adventure\nwith some POKéMON…\pCrawl through some damp grass…\nClimb rocky, rugged mountains…\pCross the raging seas…\nWander about in dark caves…\pAnd, sometimes, even get a little\nhomesick…\pIt must be fabulous to travel!$
NORMAN became our town's new\nGYM LEADER.\pI think he called his family over from\nsomewhere far away.$
I battled NORMAN once, but, whew,\nhe was way too strong.\pHow would I put it?\pI just got the feeling that he\nlives for POKéMON.$
Even if a POKéMON is weak now,\nit will grow stronger.\pThe most important thing is love!\nLove for your POKéMON!$
Do you use REPEL?\nIt keeps POKéMON away, so it's\luseful when you're in a hurry.$
Do you have any ANTIDOTES with\nyou?\pIf you walk around with a poisoned\nPOKéMON, it will lose HP until it faints.\lTake some ANTIDOTES with you.$
That PC-based POKéMON Storage\nSystem…\pWhoever made it must be some kind\nof a scientific wizard!$
When my POKéMON ate an\nORAN BERRY, it regained HP!$
There are many types of POKéMON.\pAll types have their strengths and\nweaknesses against other types.\pDepending on the types of POKéMON,\na battle could be easy or hard.$
For example, your TREECKO\nis a GRASS type.\pIt's strong against the WATER and\nGROUND types.\pBut, it's weak against FIRE-type\nPOKéMON.$
For example, your TORCHIC\nis a FIRE type.\pIt's strong against the GRASS and\nBUG types.\pBut, it's weak against WATER-type\nPOKéMON.$
For example, your MUDKIP\nis a WATER type.\pIt's strong against the FIRE type.\pBut, it's weak against GRASS-type\nand ELECTRIC-type POKéMON.$
You're…\nAh, you must be {PLAYER}{KUN}, right?\pThank you for playing with WALLY a\nlittle while ago.\pHe's been frail and sickly ever\nsince he was a baby.\pWe've sent him to stay with my relatives\nin VERDANTURF TOWN for a while.\pThe air is a lot cleaner there\nthan it is here.\pWhat's that? Where's WALLY?\nHe's already left, our WALLY.\pI wonder where he could have\ngotten by now?$
I wonder how our WALLY is doing?$
{PLAYER}{KUN}! Please excuse us for\ndragging you here this way.\pBut our WALLY's become very healthy\nsince he went to VERDANTURF TOWN.\pWe owe it all to you!\pWhen WALLY left town, you helped\nhim catch a POKéMON, right?\pI think that made WALLY really\nhappy.\pActually, not just WALLY.\nIt made me, his father, happy too.\pHappy that he's gained such a great\nfriend as you.\pThis isn't a bribe or anything, but\nI'd really like you to have this.$
If your POKéMON can SURF, you'll be\nable to go to all sorts of places.$
WALLY's coming home soon.\nI'm looking forward to that.$
Oh? You met WALLY in\nEVER GRANDE CITY?\pOh, {PLAYER}{KUN}, don't be silly.\pHe may have gotten healthy, but he\ncan't go somewhere far away like\lthat all by himself.$
WALLY was really happy when he told\nus that he caught a POKéMON.\pIt's been ages since I've seen him\nsmile like that.$
I want you to keep this a secret\nfrom my husband…\pBut our WALLY left VERDANTURF TOWN\nwithout telling anyone.\pYou know, WALLY is frail, but\nhe's surprisingly strong-willed.\pI'm sure that he'll come back safe\nand sound one day!$
Hmmm…\nNot a one to be found…$
Hello, have you seen any POKéMON\ncalled SHROOMISH around here?\pI really love that POKéMON.$
I was going to ambush you, but you\nhad to dawdle in PETALBURG WOODS\lforever, didn't you?\pI got sick of waiting, so here I am!$
You! DEVON RESEARCHER!\pHand over those papers!$
Aiyeeeh!\pYou're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\nYou've got to help me, please!$
Hunh? What do you think you're doing?\nWhat, you're going to protect him?\pNo one who crosses TEAM AQUA\ngets any mercy, not even a kid!\pCome on and battle me!$
You're kidding me! You're tough!$
Grrr… You've got some nerve\nmeddling with TEAM AQUA!\lCome on and battle me again!\pI wish I could say that, but I'm out of\nPOKéMON…\pAnd, hey, we of TEAM AQUA are also\nafter something in RUSTBORO.\pI'll let you go today!$
Whew…\nThat was awfully close!\pThanks to you, he didn't rob me of\nthese important papers.\pI know, I'll give you a GREAT BALL as\nmy thanks!$
Didn't that TEAM AQUA thug say\nthey were after something in\lRUSTBORO, too?$
Uh-oh! It's a crisis!\nI can't be wasting time!$
You're loaded with items.\nI can't give you this GREAT BALL.$
I caught a whole bunch of POKéMON!\pGo, go, go!\nMy BUG POKéMON team!$
I have all these POKéMON,\nbut I couldn't win…$
I caught a bunch of POKéMON.\nNow I'm out of POKé BALLS.$
If you take BUG POKéMON to school,\nyou get to be instantly popular!$
I can't be popular if I lose.$
If you have a big BUG POKéMON,\npeople respect you for it.$
I want a rematch when my BUG\nPOKéMON grow up!\pI'm registering you in my POKéNAV!$
I want a rematch when my BUG \nPOKéMON grow up!\pI'm registering you in my POKéNAV!$
My BUG POKéMON have grown.\nI'll be popular again.$
I can't be popular if I lose.$
You get to be popular if you have\nstrong POKéMON, right?\lSo, I've been training hard.$
Yo, there!\nYour POKéMON doing okay?\pIf your POKéMON are weak and you want\nto avoid battles, you should stay out\lof tall grass.$
Sometimes, there are things on the\nground even if you can't see them.\pThat's why I always check where I'm\nwalking.$
Oh, neat!\nThat's the BADGE from RUSTBORO GYM!\pYou must be a TRAINER.\nYou should try using this item.$
It's a MIRACLE SEED.\nIf a POKéMON holds that item, its\lGRASS-type moves become stronger.\pBesides MIRACLE SEED, I think there are\nother convenient items for POKéMON\lto hold.$
TRAINER TIPS\pAny POKéMON that appears even once\nin a battle is awarded EXP Points.\pTo raise a weak POKéMON, put it at the\nleft of the team list.\pAs soon as a battle starts, switch it\nout. It will earn EXP Points without\lbeing exposed to any harm.$
TRAINER TIPS\pIn addition to Hit Points (HP), POKéMON\nhave Power Points (PP) that are used to\lmake moves during battle.\pIf a POKéMON runs out of PP, it must be\ntaken to a POKéMON CENTER.$
H-help me!$
Hello! You over there!\nPlease! Help!\pIn my BAG!\nThere's a POKé BALL!$
Wh-Where are you going?!\nDon't leave me like this!$

If POKéMON get tired, take them to\na POKéMON CENTER.\pThere's a POKéMON CENTER in OLDALE\nTOWN right close by.$

That seaside cottage is where\nMR. BRINEY lives.\pHe was once a mighty sailor who never\nfeared the sea, however stormy.$
The sea, huh?\pI wonder what it's like at the bottom\nof the sea?$
If you're going to throw a POKé BALL,\nweaken the wild POKéMON first.\pIt will be easier to catch if it's been\npoisoned, burned, or lulled to sleep.$
You're a thief if you try to steal\nsomeone else's POKéMON.\pYou should throw POKé BALLS only at\nwild POKéMON.$
Oh, no, I'm not a TRAINER.\pBut that's right, if TRAINERS lock eyes,\nit's a challenge to battle.\pIf you don't want to battle, stay out\nof their sight.$
I like filling my mouth with seeds,\nthen spitting them out fast!\pYou can have this, so you try it out!\pUse it on a POKéMON, and it will learn\na move for firing seeds rapidly.$
A word of advice!\pA TM, TECHNICAL MACHINE, is good only\nfor one-time use.\pOnce you use it, it's gone.\nThink twice before using it!$

TRAINER TIPS\pIn the HOENN region there are pairs\nof TRAINERS who challenge others\lfor 2-on-2 POKéMON battles called\lDOUBLE BATTLES.\pIn a DOUBLE BATTLE, the TRAINER must\nsend out two POKéMON, the one at the\lleft of the list and the top one.\lWatch how POKéMON are lined up.$

If one of my POKéMON knew the move\nfor carrying me across water on its\lback, I could get rid of this inner tube.$
TEAM AQUA's activities…\nWe can't talk about them yet.$
I want to get going to SLATEPORT and\nkick up a ruckus!$
This is my first job after joining\nTEAM AQUA. It's a little scary.$
TEAM AQUA's actions should bring\nsmiles to people's faces!$
MAY: Hi, {PLAYER}{KUN}, long time no see!\pWhile I was searching for other\nPOKéMON, my POKéMON grew stronger.\pSo…\nHow about a little battle?$
Yikes!\nYou're better than I expected!$
MAY: {PLAYER}{KUN}, you've been busy\ntraining, too, haven't you?\pI think you deserve a reward!\nThis is from me!$
MAY: That's an ITEMFINDER.\pTry it out. If there is an item that's\nnot visible, it emits a sound.\pOkay, {PLAYER}{KUN}, let's meet again!\pI know it's a little silly coming from\nme, but I think you should train a lot\lharder for the next time.$
BRENDAN: Hey, {PLAYER}.\nSo this is where you were.\lHow's it going?\pHave you been raising your POKéMON?\nI'll check for you.$
Hmm…\nYou're pretty good.$
BRENDAN: {PLAYER}, you've trained\nwithout me noticing…\pGood enough!\nHere, take this.$
BRENDAN: That's an ITEMFINDER.\pUse it to root around for items that\naren't visible.\pIf it senses something, it emits\na sound.\pAnyway, I'm off to look for new\nPOKéMON.$
Wouldn't it be great to ride a BIKE\nat full speed on CYCLING ROAD?$
How do you like the way my raven-\ncolored hair streams behind me?\pI grew my hair out just for that.$
Oh, hey, you got that BIKE from RYDEL!\pOh, it's glaringly obvious.\nIt says right on your bike…\pRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\pRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\pRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\pRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\nRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL,\pRYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL, RYDEL…\nThat name's everywhere.\pYou should ride it around all over\nthe place--it's good advertising!$
The two roads, one above, one below…\pA road each for people and POKéMON.\nPerhaps that is right and fair.$
I don't have a BIKE, so I'll take\na leisurely walk on the low road.$
Learning techniques will make BIKE\nriding even more fun.\pThere are some places that you can\nreach only by using a BIKE technique.$
Which should I choose?\pMake a beeline for MAUVILLE on\nCYCLING ROAD, or take the low road\land look for POKéMON?$
Number of collisions:\n… … {STR_VAR_1}!\pTotal time:\n… … {STR_VAR_2}!$
Bravo! Splendid showing!\pYour love of cycling comes from deep\nwithin your heart.\lYou've shaken me to my very soul!$
Your technique is remarkable.\pI suggest you speed up a bit while\nstill avoiding collisions.$
I would consider you a work in\nprogress.\pStill, I hope you don't forget the\nsheer pleasure of cycling.$
My word… Your cycling skills border\non terrifying.\pMost certainly, you need much more\npractice riding.$
…I am aghast…\pYou're perhaps not cut out for this\nunfortunate cycling business.\pYou ought to give serious thought to\nreturning that BIKE to RYDEL.$
This is CYCLING ROAD.\pIf you were to ride from MAUVILLE to\nSLATEPORT on a MACH BIKE, you would\lbe rated for the number of collisions\land your total time.$
Regardless of the results, I count on\nseeing more challenges from you.\lAlways aim higher!$
On this CYCLING ROAD, those riding\nMACH BIKES are rated for their number\lof collisions and their total times.\pACRO BIKES do not qualify for rating.\nThey are easy to turn, so it's not fair.$

You're so casual about winning!$
Humph! I'm not upset!\nNot me!$

There should be a tower made of sand\naround here somewhere.\pBut for some reason, it can be seen\nsometimes, and sometimes not.\pThat's why I call it the MIRAGE TOWER.$
I see it!\nThe tower of sand!\pThe sand tower they called a mirage\nis clearly visible!\pBut it looks so fragile…\nIt could crumble away anytime…\pI want to go inside it, but I can't\nget my courage up for it…$
Whoa…\nThat was shocking.\pSand rained down in chunks all of\na sudden.\pWhat was it like inside?\nWere there sandy ghosts and such?$

That's right.\nTake your time and rest up!$
Oh, dear, dear.\nAre your POKéMON still tired?\pYou should take another rest here.\nThat's a fine idea. You should do that.$
Is that so?\nYou don't need to be shy about it.$
You're the first TRAINER I've seen who\ndeploys POKéMON so masterfully.\pBut, I should tell you--my son is\nstronger than you.\pHe even took the POKéMON LEAGUE\nchallenge, I'll have you know.$
We use this MACHO BRACE to more\neffectively strengthen our POKéMON\lin training.\pSince you've beaten all of us here,\nI don't know if you need it, but we\lwould like you to have our MACHO BRACE.$
When it comes to POKéMON battles,\nwe tend to be pretty passionate.$
Mommy is stronger than Daddy.\pI'm stronger than Mommy.\pAnd Grandma's stronger than me!\pBut my big brother is even stronger\nthan Grandma.$
There's no question that you're strong.\pBut if you were to battle my grandson,\nyou'd end up crying in frustration.\pHe's much stronger than any TRAINER\nour family knows.\pHe must be challenging the POKéMON\nLEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\pKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!$
My grandson must be challenging the\nPOKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION by now.\pKnowing my grandson, he could be the\nCHAMPION already!$

LANETTE: Oh! {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pI'm sorry everything is so cluttered…\nWhen I get engrossed in research,\lthings end up this way…\pThis is embarrassing… Please keep\nthis a secret in exchange for this.$
May I offer advice about my POKéMON\nStorage System?\pYou should organize your BOXES so you\ncan tell which POKéMON are in them.$
It's LANETTE's research notes.\nThere's information about BOXES.\pDesign BOXES to hold 30 POKéMON each.\pEach TRAINER should be able to store\n420 POKéMON on the PC system.\pKeep reading?$
A marking system should be added to\nmake POKéMON easier to organize.\pThe name and wallpaper design of each\nBOX will be made changeable to please\lthe stored POKéMON.\pKeep reading?$
When storing a POKéMON, it should be\nsent to the BOX inspected last.\pIf that BOX is full, the received\nPOKéMON is stored in the next BOX.\pIn other words, when a BOX is examined,\nit is automatically selected as the BOX\lto which POKéMON are sent.$
{PLAYER} closed the notebook.$
There's an e-mail from someone on\nthe PC.\p“… … … … … … …\p“Your Storage System offers more\nconvenience than mine.\p“It has a lot of user-friendly features\nthat make it fun and useful, too.\p“It makes me proud that I played\na part in its development.\p“Here's hoping that you'll continue\nresearch in Storage Systems.\p“From BILL\n… … … … … … … …”$

TRAINER TIPS\pYour BAG has several POCKETS.\pItems you obtain are automatically\nplaced in the appropriate POCKETS.\pNo TRAINER can afford to be without\na BAG of their own.$
That RUSTURF TUNNEL there…\pAt first, we had a huge work crew boring\nthrough rock with the latest machinery.\lBut, we had to stop.\pIt turns out that we would have had\na negative effect on wild POKéMON in\lthe area.\pSo, we've got nothing to do but loll\naround here doing nothing.$
There's a man digging his way to\nVERDANTURF all by his lonesome.\lHe's desperate to get through.\pHe says that if he digs little by little\nwithout using machines, he won't\ldisturb POKéMON, and he'll avoid\lharming the natural environment.\pI wonder if he made it through yet.$

Oh, is that so?\pDEVON's technological expertise\nis outstanding, I tell you.$
Oh, now that's a surprise!\nYou have not one, but two, fossils?\pUnfortunately, my machine can only\nregenerate one POKéMON at a time.\pWould you like to pick one of your\nfossils for regeneration?$
Excellent!\nLet's do this right away.\p{PLAYER} handed the {STR_VAR_1} to\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.$
The FOSSIL REGENERATOR, which I made,\nis incredible.\pBut it has one drawback--it takes\na long time to work.\pSo, uh… How about you go for a stroll\nand look around for a while?$
Thanks for waiting!\pYour fossilized POKéMON has been\nbrought back to life!\pThe fossil was an ancient POKéMON.\n{STR_VAR_2}, it was!$
{PLAYER} received {STR_VAR_2} from\nthe DEVON RESEARCHER.$
Uh-oh, you've got too many POKéMON.\nYou have no room for this one.$
I'm trying to develop a new feature\nfor the POKéNAV…\pBut it's not going well.$
Well, now what shall I work on\ndeveloping next?\pOur company allows us to make our\ninspirations into reality.\pOne couldn't ask for a better\nenvironment as an engineer.$
I'm MR. STONE, the PRESIDENT of\nthe DEVON CORPORATION.\pI'd just got word about you!\pYou saved our staff not just once,\nbut twice!\pI have a favor to ask of an amazing\nperson like you.\pI understand that you're delivering\na package to SLATEPORT's SHIPYARD.\pWell, on the way, could you stop off in\nDEWFORD TOWN?\pI was hoping that you'd deliver a\nLETTER to STEVEN in DEWFORD.$
MR. STONE: Now, you should know that\nI am a great PRESIDENT.\pSo, I'd never be so cheap as to ask\na favor for nothing in return.\pThat's why I want you to have this!$
{PLAYER} received a POKéNAV.$
MR. STONE: That device…\pIt's a POKéMON NAVIGATOR, or POKéNAV\nfor short.\pIt's an indispensable tool for any\nTRAINER on an adventure.\pIt has a map of the HOENN region.\pYou can check the locations of\nDEWFORD and SLATEPORT easily!\pBy the way, I've heard that sinister\ncriminals--MAGMA and AQUA, I believe--\lhave been making trouble far and wide.\pI think it would be best if you rested\nup before you go on your way.$
MR. STONE: Well, then, {PLAYER}{KUN},\ngo with caution and care!$
MR. STONE: I'm counting on you!$
MR. STONE: You delivered my LETTER?\nThank you kindly!\pThis is my way of thanking you.\nIt should help you, a TRAINER.$
MR. STONE: A POKéMON holding that\nEXP. SHARE will be given some of the\lEXP Points from battle.\pIt will get EXP Points even if it didn't\nactually battle.\pI would say EXP. SHARE is quite useful\nfor raising weak POKéMON.$
MR. STONE: Since my youth, I've immersed\nmyself in work.\pConsequently, I'm not familiar with\ntrends and that sort of thing.\pBut do young people all want to be\nTRAINERS in the POKéMON LEAGUE?$
This is the DEVON CORPORATION's\nthird floor.\pOur PRESIDENT's OFFICE is on\nthis floor.\pAnyway, I can't tell you how much I'm\ngrateful for what you've done.\pUm… By the way, that parcel\nyou got back for us…\pCould I get you to deliver that to\nthe SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT?\pIt would be awful if those robbers\ntried to take it again.\pUh… Hehehe, so, uh, could I count\non you to do that for me?\pOh, that's right.\nCould you wait here a second?$
Our PRESIDENT would like to have\na word with you.\pPlease come with me.$
Please, go ahead.$
If you visit the SHIPYARD in SLATEPORT,\nyou should go see CAPT. STERN.$
DEVON's new products, the REPEAT BALL\nand TIMER BALL, have become hugely\lpopular among TRAINERS.$
It's a collection of rare rocks and\nstones assembled by the PRESIDENT.$
Every POKéMON has a special ability\nthat it can use.$
POKéMON are such strange creatures.$
Oh, it's so hard every day…\pWhat's hard?\nYou need to ask?\pIt's trying to figure out what to\nmake for meals every day.\pIt really isn't easy coming up with\nmeals every day.$
Oh, hello!\nWelcome to the PEPPER household.\pI have a question for you.\nHave you ever baby-sat?\pYou see, I'm a new father, so raising\na child is all new to me.\pAnd I have a problem. My daughter\nWALDA doesn't laugh enough.\pI think she'd laugh for me if I told\nher something funny.\pDo you know of a funny word or\nphrase you can tell me?$
I've been saying “{STR_VAR_1}”\nto amuse her lately.\pDo you know of a better word or\na phrase that might work?$
Oh, that's wonderful.\nSo, let's hear it, your suggestion.$
Oh, is that right?\pWell, if you come up with a good\nsuggestion, I'm all ears.$
Ah, I see.\nWell, let's give it a try, shall we?$
{STR_VAR_1}.\n{STR_VAR_1}.\pOh, yes! She's laughing!\nOh, I am as delighted as she!$
Ah, I see.\nWell, let's give it a try, shall we?$
{STR_VAR_1}.\n{STR_VAR_1}.\pHmmm… She's not smiling at all.\nMaybe WALDA is one serious child…$
Oh, so you don't know any good words.\nI'd better think for myself, then.\pHmm…\nHow about “{STR_VAR_1}”?\lLet's see if that will work.$
{STR_VAR_1}.\n{STR_VAR_1}.\pHmmm… She's not smiling at all.\nMaybe WALDA is one serious child…$
Oh, so you don't know any good words.\nI guess I'll try to amuse her with\lthe saying I used before.\pAnyways, if you have a good suggestion,\ndon't hesitate in telling me, okay?$
Thank you!\pThanks to you, my darling WALDA\nlaughed for me!\pActually, I may not look all that\nspecial, but I'm one of DEVON\lCORPORATION's top researchers.\pSo, how about I do something in return\nfor you?\pI know, I'll add some new wallpaper\npatterns for the BOXES in the PC\lPOKéMON Storage System.\pIn the wallpaper pattern menu,\nselect “FRIENDS.”\pThat will give you access to the new\nwallpaper patterns.$
It's a POKéMON plush DOLL!$
DEVON CORPORATION's workers live in\nthis building.$
SKITTY: Gyaaaah!$
Way back in the old days, DEVON was just\na teeny, tiny company.$
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\pMy daddy made this!\nBut I can't use it, so you can have it.$
My daddy's working at the CORPORATION.\pWhen I grow up, I'm going to work for\nDEVON, too.$
DEVON's PRESIDENT likes to collect\nrare stones.$
I think the PRESIDENT's son also\ncollects rare stones.$
Yo, how's it going?\pListen, my friend!\nWould you like to become the CHAMPION?\pI'm no TRAINER, not me, but I can\nsure give you winning advice.\pThat's settled, then! We'll aim for the\nPOKéMON CHAMPIONSHIP together!\pIt's your job as a TRAINER to collect\nGYM BADGES, am I right?\pBut GYM LEADERS aren't pushovers!\pAnd that's where I come in!\nI'm here to provide expert advice!\pROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, is a user\nof ROCK-type POKéMON.\pThe ROCK type is very durable, but\nit can't stand WATER-type and\lGRASS-type moves.\pCome see me afterwards, if you beat\nthe GYM LEADER.\pWell, go for it!$
Whoa! What a breathtaking victory!\nMy cheering must've worked!\pGreat!\nCheck your TRAINER CARD.\pThe STONE BADGE you got should be\nproperly recorded on it.\pIn other words…\pYou've climbed the first step on\nthe stairs to the CHAMPIONSHIP!\pThat's got to feel awesome!$
Don't take us GYM TRAINERS lightly!\nI'll show you why we're better!$
You were too good for me…$
You haven't seen anything of the ROCK\ntype's terrifying power!$
If you can't beat me, you won't stand\na chance against ROXANNE!$
Wow! You've got some potential!$
ROXANNE is stronger than me by\nseveral times.\pYou'd better be on your guard!$
We might be in the middle of town,\nbut so what?\pMy ROCK POKéMON need room to\nrampage!$
Oh, man oh man!\nOur challenger is one feisty customer!$
I have to hand it to our LEADER.\pIt took smarts and sense for her to\npick the ROCK type at her young age.$
Hello, I am ROXANNE, the RUSTBORO\nPOKéMON GYM LEADER.\pI became a GYM LEADER so that I might\napply what I learned at the POKéMON\lTRAINER'S SCHOOL in battle.\pWould you kindly demonstrate how you\nbattle, and with which POKéMON?$
So…\nI lost…\pIt seems that I still have much more\nto learn…\pI understand.\pThe POKéMON LEAGUE's rules state\nthat TRAINERS are to be given this\lif they defeat a GYM LEADER.\pPlease accept the official POKéMON\nLEAGUE STONE BADGE.$
{PLAYER} received the STONE BADGE\nfrom ROXANNE.$
The STONE BADGE heightens the ATTACK\npower of your POKéMON.\pIt also enables them to use the HM move\nCUT outside of battle.\pPlease take this with you, too.$
That TECHNICAL MACHINE, TM39,\ncontains ROCK TOMB.\pIt not only inflicts damage by dropping\nrocks, it also lowers SPEED.\pIf you use a TM, it instantly teaches\nthe move to a POKéMON.\pRemember, a TM can be used only once,\nso think before you use it.$
Since you are so strong, you should\nchallenge other GYM LEADERS.\pBy battling many TRAINERS, you should\nlearn many things.$

Registered GYM LEADER ROXANNE\nin the POKéNAV.$
ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again.\nI'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\pI'm sure we've both experienced many\nbattles since we last met.\pI would like to see how much better\nwe've become. Let us battle!$
Grr…\nAgain, I have lost…$
ROXANNE: I still have much to learn\nwhen it comes to battling POKéMON.\pThat awareness makes me love battling\nall that much more!$
ROXANNE: I'm so glad to see you again.\nI'm ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER here.\pI'm sure we've both experienced many\nbattles since we last met.\pI would like to see how much better\nwe've become…\pOh, no…\nYou only have one POKéMON with you?\pPlease return with at least one more\nPOKéMON.$
Huh? My POKéMON is cute?\nSure, I knew that.\pBut if you really want, I'm willing\nto trade it to you.\pI'll trade you my {STR_VAR_2} for\na {STR_VAR_1} if you want.$
Eheheh…\nPlease be good to my POKéMON.$
Huh? That doesn't look anything like\na {STR_VAR_1} to me.$
Oh, if you don't want to, that's okay.\nBut my POKéMON is cute, you know…$
Any POKéMON can be cute if you raise\nit with care and kindness.$
In all sorts of places, there are all\nsorts of POKéMON and people.\pI find that fascinating, so I go to all\nsorts of places.$
The TRAINER'S SCHOOL is excellent.\pIf you study there, you could even\nbecome a GYM LEADER.$
ROXANNE, the GYM LEADER, really knows\na lot about POKéMON.\pShe's really strong, too!$
For my own POKéMON, I give them\nperfectly suited nicknames!\pIt's my expression of, uh…\noriginality, yes, that's it!$
But giving the name PEKACHU to\na PIKACHU? It seems pointless.\pI suppose it is good to use a name\nthat's easy to understand, but…$
PEKACHU: Peka!$
I'm buying some PARLYZ HEALS and\nANTIDOTES.\pJust in case I run into SHROOMISH\nin PETALBURG WOODS.$
My POKéMON evolved.\nIt has a lot of HP now.\pI should buy SUPER POTIONS for it\ninstead of ordinary POTIONS.$
I'm getting an ESCAPE ROPE just in\ncase I get lost in a cave.\pI just need to use it to get back to\nthe entrance.$
My POKéMON has a NAIVE nature, and my\nfriend's has a JOLLY nature.\pIt's fascinating how POKéMON have\npersonalities!$
Just like people, there are male and\nfemale POKéMON.\pBut no one seems to have any idea how\nthey're different.$
The man next door gave me an HM!\pI used it to teach my POKéMON how to\nCUT down skinny trees.$
The blackboard lists status changes\nthat may affect POKéMON in battle.$
Which topic do you want to read?$
If a POKéMON is poisoned, it will\nsteadily lose HP.\pThe effects of poison remain after\na battle.\pA poisoned POKéMON's HP will drop\nwhile it is traveling.\pHeal a poisoning using an ANTIDOTE.$
If a POKéMON becomes paralyzed,\nits SPEED drops.\pIt may also not be able to move while\nit is in battle.\pParalysis remains after battle.\nCure it using a PARLYZ HEAL.$
If a POKéMON falls asleep, it will be\nunable to attack.\pA POKéMON may wake up on its own,\nbut if a battle ends while it is\lsleeping, it will stay asleep.\pWake it up using an AWAKENING.$
A burn reduces ATTACK power, and it\nsteadily reduces the victim's HP.\pA burn lingers after battle.\nCure a burn using a BURN HEAL.$
If a POKéMON is frozen, it becomes\ncompletely helpless.\pIt will remain frozen after battle.\nThaw it out using an ICE HEAL.$
Students who don't study get a little\ntaste of my QUICK CLAW.\pWhether or not you are a good student \nwill be evident from the way you use\lthis item.$
A POKéMON holding the QUICK CLAW will\noccasionally speed up and get to move\lbefore its opponent.\pThere are many other items that are\nmeant to be held by POKéMON.\pJust those alone will give you many\ntopics to study!$
I'm trading POKéMON with my friend\nright now.$
I always wanted a SEEDOT, and\nI'm finally getting one!$
POKéMON can hold items, but they\ndon't know what to do with man-made\litems like POTION and ANTIDOTE.$
You know how some POKéMON moves can\nconfuse a POKéMON?\pA confused POKéMON will sometimes\nattack itself without meaning to.\pBut once it leaves battle, it will\nreturn to normal.$
A POKéMON holding a BERRY will heal\nitself…\pThere are many kinds of items that\nPOKéMON can hold…\pBoy, it sure is hard taking notes\ndown…$
It's this student's notebook…\pPOKéMON are to be caught using\nPOKé BALLS.\pUp to six POKéMON can accompany\na TRAINER.\pA TRAINER is someone who catches\nPOKéMON, raises them, and battles\lwith them.\pA TRAINER's mission is to defeat\nthe strong TRAINERS who await\lchallengers in POKéMON GYMS.$
Hello? Didn't we meet before?\nI think back in PETALBURG CITY.\pLet me introduce myself.\nMy name's SCOTT.\pI've been traveling everywhere in\nsearch of outstanding TRAINERS.\pMore specifically, I'm looking for\nPOKéMON battle experts.\pSo, what brings you to this SCHOOL?\nAre you a TRAINER, too?\pThe first thing you should do is to\nhave a POKéMON learn the move CUT.\pIf I remember correctly, someone in\nthis town has CUT.$
SCOTT: Hmm…\pThe talent levels of the students here\nare unknown. The potential's there.$
SCOTT: Oh, what's that?\pIt's a STONE BADGE, isn't it?\nThat's pretty impressive, I'd say.\pBut, you know, I would've loved to see\nyou in battle.\pIt's hard to tell what you're like as\na TRAINER from a LEAGUE BADGE.$

What, are you coming?\nCome and get some, then!$
PEEKO: Pii pihyoh!$
Grah, keelhaul it all!\pThat hostage POKéMON turned out to\nbe worthless!\pAnd to think I made a getaway…\nIn this tunnel to nowhere!\pHey! You!\nSo you want to battle me?$
Urrrggh! My career in crime comes to\na dead end!$
This is plain not right…\pThe BOSS told me this would be a\nslick-and-easy job to pull.\pAll I had to do was steal some package\nfrom DEVON.\pTch!\nYou want it back that badly, take it!$
PEEKO!\nAm I glad to see you're safe!$
PEEKO owes her life to you!\pThey call me MR.

… …\pWhy can't they keep digging?\nIs the bedrock too hard?\pMy beloved awaits me in VERDANTURF\nTOWN just beyond here…\pIf RUSTBORO and VERDANTURF were\njoined by this tunnel, I could visit\lher every day…\pBut this…\nWhat am I to do?$
To get from RUSTBORO to VERDANTURF,\nyou need to go to DEWFORD, then pass\lthrough SLATEPORT and MAUVILLE…$
Wow! You shattered that boulder\nblocking the way.\pTo show you how much I appreciate it,\nI'd like you to have this HM.$
That HM contains STRENGTH.\pIf a muscular POKéMON were to learn\nthat, it would be able to move even\llarge boulders.$
WANDA!\nNow I can see you anytime!\pWANDA: That's…wonderful.\pPlease, take some rest at my home.$
On the other side of this rock…\nMy boyfriend is there.\pHe… He's not just digging the tunnel\nto come see me.\pHe works his hands raw and rough\nfor the benefit of everyone.$
What do you call a wild man up in the\nmountains? A mountain man, right?\pSo why don't they call a POKéMON in\nthe mountains a mountain POKéMON?$
My POKéMON…\nRan out of power…$
They halted development here to\nprotect POKéMON, right?\lThere's a feel-good story!$
SCOTT: Well, hi, hi!\n{PLAYER}{KUN}, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pSomething's come up, so I have to\ndisembark, but am I glad to see you!\pCongratulations, LEAGUE CHAMPION!\pThere's a place I'd like to invite\nsomeone like you.\pIt's the…\nBATTLE FRONTIER!\pWhat's the place like?\nYou'll understand when you see it!\pI've spoken with the ship's CAPTAIN\nabout this.\pThe next time you take a ferry,\nyou should be able to sail to\lthe BATTLE FRONTIER.\pOkay, {PLAYER}{KUN}, I'll be waiting for you\nat the BATTLE FRONTIER!$

That was an enjoyable match!$
I get so excited imagining what kinds\nof POKéMON I'll get to see in the next\lCONTEST. The anticipation of it thrills!$
Are your friends strong?$
Your friends are, indeed, strong.$
Friends need not be human.\nFor me, POKéMON are treasured friends!$
Child…\nDid you knock on the door?$
A loss is to be accepted without haste\nor panic.$
To be never ruffled in any situation is\nthe GENTLEMAN's code of conduct.$
JED: I feel a little shy about this, but…\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!$
JED: Sigh…$
JED: It's the first time that our lovey-\ndovey power couldn't prevail!\lYou must be an awesome TRAINER!$
JED: You only have one POKéMON?\nIsn't that just too lonesome?$
LEA: I feel a little silly, but…\nWe'll show you our lovey-dovey power!$
LEA: Oh, boo!$
LEA: I can't believe it!\nOur lovey-dovey power failed…\lYou must be an awesome TRAINER!$
LEA: I wanted to battle…\nBut you don't even have two POKéMON…$
Ah, you've come just in time.\pI'm bored, you see.\nYou may entertain me.$
…That will do.$
Perhaps I shall get Father to acquire\na yacht for me.\lA yacht for me and POKéMON!$
Oh, you're such an adorable TRAINER.\nWould you like to have tea?\lOr would you rather battle?$
I see.\nYou're the active sort.$
A world cruise on a luxury liner has its\ncharms, I must say…\pBut, I will admit there is an appealing\nside to touring HOENN by ferry.$
Uh… Hi! I… I'm not acting suspicious!\nUh… You can have this! For free!\pIt… Honestly, I didn't SNATCH it from\nsomeone! I'd never do such a thing!\lIt's clean! You can use it!$
SNATCH steals the beneficial effects\nof certain moves before they can be\lused by a foe or ally.$

I'm the ENERGY GURU! I'll go for it and\nsell you what you need!$
Oh?\nYour {STR_VAR_1}…$
Went for it stupendously!\pAs its reward, please give it this\nEFFORT RIBBON.$
{PLAYER} received the EFFORT RIBBON.$
{PLAYER} put the EFFORT RIBBON\non {STR_VAR_1}.$
You have to go for it a little harder.\pIf you do, I'll give your POKéMON\nsomething nice.$
Oh! Your {STR_VAR_1}, that EFFORT\nRIBBON looks good on it!$
The light of the lighthouse reaches\ndozens of miles away.\pI wonder if it doesn't startle POKéMON\nin the sea.$
Ooh, look at this!\pThe seaweed you can get around these\nparts is fresh and full of life.\pWhy, it looks like it can even rear up\nand attack!$
Where the water is clean, the fruits\nof bountiful harvest gather.\pAnd where people gather, a market\nsoon starts.\pThat is how a town is born and grows.$
Shopping where you can breathe the\nscent of the ocean…\pSLATEPORT is such a wonderful place!$
If you put DOLLS or CUSHIONS on\nthe floor, they'll get dirty.\pI'm going to buy some BRICKS so my\nDOLLS and CUSHIONS won't get dirty\lwhen I leave them out.$
Wroooar! I'm going to compete in\nthe BATTLE TENT, too!\pBut before that, I need to catch\nsome POKéMON!$
Whew… I'm just bushed…\pI hiked over from MAUVILLE CITY.\nBut, boy, this city's huge.\pIf I'd known this, I would've ridden\nmy BIKE here.$
STERN, the fellow who built the\nMUSEUM, also happens to be the leader\lof an undersea exploration team.\pSo, everyone calls him CAPT. STERN.$
What is that over there?\nThat long line…$
When I was a child, I visited\nthe MUSEUM often.\pI used to dream about the mysteries of\nthe sea after seeing the exhibits.$
Hey, there! Quit pushing!\nThis is the line, can't you see?$
TEAM AQUA has a policy of\nassembling and dispersing at\lthe operation site.$
Our BOSS is brilliant.\pWhat would he want to do with\na MUSEUM now?$
What's the new scheme, I wonder?\pOur BOSS is scary when he's mad, so\nI'd better not screw things up…$
If there's something we need in\nthe MUSEUM, we should take it all!$
Hey, you there!\nDon't butt in!$
A long line, huh?\pIt reminds me of the times I lined up to\nbuy smash-hit games…$
Why are we even lining up and paying?\nWe should just march in!$
What?\nWhat do you want?$
You want to read this sign?\nI'll read it for you!$
Let's see…\pUm… I think it says something like\n“the life in the sea is endless.”\pYup, I'm pretty sure that's what\nit says.$
Grumble…\pI should've brought my Game Boy\nAdvance so I wouldn't get bored in line…\pGrumble…$
When this operation's over, I'll take\nyou to a hot spring spa!\pThat's what our leader said.\nI can't wait!$
The sea is just so vast…\pCould the sea have been made by\nthe tears shed by POKéMON?$
Do you know what they do with old\nships that become too creaky to sail?\pThey sink them in the sea so they\nbecome habitats for POKéMON.$
Whenever I visit here, I get carried\naway and buy too much.$
If you want to change your POKéMON's\nnickname, you'll have to get the NAME\lRATER to help you.$
Any POKéMON you get in a trade,\nyou can't change its nickname.\pThe original TRAINER's love for that\nPOKéMON is in the nickname.$
Recently, a BATTLE TENT was built\nin SLATEPORT.\pGYMS are fun, but the BATTLE TENT's\nawesome in its own way.\pYou should go find tough POKéMON\nfor the BATTLE TENT!$
I was hoping that it was a famous star\nso I could get an autograph.\pBut who's that being interviewed?\nIsn't that CAPT. STERN?$
That lady interviewer is so cool\nand pretty.\pWhen I grow up, I'm going to be\nan international journalist!$
CAPT. STERN says they discovered\nsomething at the bottom of the sea.\pI wonder what it is?\nWhat could it be?$
What's going on here?\pDid the good CAPTAIN come back with\na big fish from the ocean floor?$
Hey! Are you watching?\nAm I on TV?$
A TV interview! Here!\nThe CAPTAIN's a celebrity!$
TY: Okay, CAPT. STERN, a big smile\nfor the camera!$
GABBY: I see, I see. You've had a most\ninvaluable experience…$
CAPT. STERN: Yes, indeed. We intend to\nmove ahead with our exploration.$
GABBY: That's wonderful, CAPT. STERN!\nThank you for taking the time from\lyour busy schedule to talk to us.\pWe hope we can interview you again\nwith news of more discoveries!$
CAPT. STERN: Whew…\pThat was my first time to be filmed for\nTV. That was nerve-wracking.$
Oh! {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nYou're looking great!\pWe made a huge discovery on our last\nseafloor exploration.\pWe found an underwater cavern on\nROUTE 128.\pWe think it's the habitat of a POKéMON\nthat's said to have been long extinct.$
Fufufu…\nCAPT. STERN, I presume.\pWe of TEAM AQUA will assume\ncontrol of your submarine!\pYour objections are meaningless!\nWe expect your total cooperation!\pFufufu…\nJust watch and learn what TEAM\lAQUA has planned!$
CAPT. STERN: What was that all about?\pIt sounded like someone using\na megaphone…\pWhere did it come from?$
It's from the HARBOR!\pThe submarine!\nThey're trying to take it!$
{PLAYER}{KUN}!\nPlease, come with me!$

If a wild POKéMON gets hurt, it heals\nitself by chewing on BERRIES.\pDid you know that?\pSomebody saw that and got the idea\nof making medicine from BERRIES.\pDid you know that?\pTo turn BERRIES into medicine,\nthey must be crushed into powder.\pDid you know that?\pYou seem to have an interest\nin BERRIES!\pI've got something good for someone\nlike you.$
I recently had machines installed at\nPOKéMON CENTERS for crushing BERRIES.\pThe BERRY CRUSH machines are at\nthe DIRECT CORNER upstairs.\pDid you know?\pCould you make BERRY POWDER for\nme using those machines?\pI can make you all sorts of medicine\nif you bring me lots of BERRY POWDER.$
Have you brought me some\nBERRY POWDER?$
What would you like to exchange\nit with?$
Okay, you want to exchange your\nBERRY POWDER for one {STR_VAR_1}?$
Oh, dear. You don't have enough\nBERRY POWDER.$
This is fine BERRY POWDER.\nIt will make excellent medicine.\pWould you like to trade more of your\nBERRY POWDER for something else?$
Okay! When you get some more\nBERRY POWDER, bring it to me, please!$
Come back if you'd like to trade your\nBERRY POWDER for some medicine.\pI'm always running a bazaar here.\pDid you know?$
SCOTT: Huh?\nI'm sure I met you somewhere before.\pHave I introduced myself to you?\nIf not, my name's SCOTT.\pI just saw TEAM AQUA run away from\nhere like they were stung.\pLet me guess--you drove them away?$
SCOTT: Hmm…\nMaybe, just maybe, this TRAINER…$
SCOTT: All right! I think you're going\nto become a good friend.\pSo, let's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS.\p… … … … … …$
Registered this SCOTT person\nin the POKéNAV.$
SCOTT: What I'd like to do is tag along\nwith you, but I do want to keep an eye\lon the talents of other people, too.\pSo, I'll be off to roam other towns\na bit more.\pBe seeing you, {PLAYER}{KUN}!$
SCOTT: Oh, hey!\nIf it isn't {PLAYER}{KUN}!\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, let me guess--you're going\nto take the BATTLE TENT challenge?\pYeah! That's a good idea!\nThat's a really great idea!\pAfter all, a tough TRAINER is\nthe perfect fit for the BATTLE TENT!\pGive it your best effort!$
Want a tasty little bit of advice\nfor CONTESTS?\pUsing a certain move after another\ncertain kind of move sometimes gets\lyou extra attention.\pIf you know what you're doing,\nyou can score big in appeal.\pOf course, your opponents might try\ndisrupting your POKéMON's showing.$
My papa, he's a CONTEST JUDGE.\pI wonder what I should be when I\ngrow up, a JUDGE or a GYM LEADER?$
Hey, man, I'm like majorly cheesed,\nyou know. Like, you know, I just\lwanted to know why my POKéMON\lnever won, you know, like, hey?\pSo, like, I gave the JUDGE my two\ncents, you know, they're free.\pAnd he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!\nSo, like, total bummer, man!\pHey, like, you! Zip it, you know?\nJust, you know, take this!$
That's, like, TM41, you know?\nHey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?\pLike, it won't let the other guy\nuse the same move twice in a row, see?\pHey, now, you listen here, like,\nI'm not laying a torment on you!$
MC: Oh, my, my!\nNow isn't that a dandy of a POKéMON?\pPlease! Do step right up and take\npart in our splendid CONTESTS!\pYou'll do well! I'm sure of it!\nMy eyes have never failed me!$
JUDGE: Well, hello there!\nI see that you're a TRAINER!\pThen, it just wouldn't do for you\nto miss a POKéMON CONTEST!\pGet a CONTEST PASS in VERDANTURF\nCITY and enter anytime!$
It's appeal time!\nWhat should I lead with?$
They didn't pay much attention to\nmy POKéMON's appeal…\pHumph, that JUDGE, he doesn't know\na good thing when he sees it.$
Oh, hi! You must be a serious fan to get\nthis close to the action.\pI'll reward your enthusiasm with\nthis sage advice.\pIf a move goes over really well,\nthe audience will get excited.\pThe POKéMON that makes its appeal\nright when everyone's excited…\pWell, you'd think something good has\nto happen!$
I can't do this! I'm more freaked out\nthan my POKéMON.\pI'm shivering and my heart is racing!$
A battle and a CONTEST aren't the\nsame, but they are alike, too.\pYou need to work hard and believe\nin the POKéMON you've raised.$
That POKéMON looks like it's on top\nof its game, huh?\pA POKéMON that does good in the\nsecondary judging seems to be more\lrelaxed when it's doing appeals.$
Will you look at that sorry sight?\pHeh, my POKéMON's absolutely better\nthan that lot!$
Don't you get the urge to move with\nPOKéMON if they're putting on an\lenergetic appeal?$
POKéMON CONTESTS\nHYPER RANK STAGE!$
So, like, I couldn't find myself any\nPOKéMON that were, like, for me.\pSo, I figured, like, hey, I should file\na complaint to the guy there?\pAnd he wouldn't hear me out, like, hey!\nSo, like, total bummer, man!\pHey, like, you! Zip it, you know?\nJust, you know, take this!$
That's, like, TM41, you know?\nHey, it's TORMENT, you hearing me?\pLike, it won't let the other guy\nuse the same move twice in a row, see?\pHey, now, you listen here, like,\nI'm not laying a torment on you!$
I don't really like BUG POKéMON,\nbut maybe I'll try using some for\la change of pace.\pWho knows, I might even get to like\nthem!$
You can battle all you want here even\nif you don't have any tough POKéMON.$
Wouldn't it be nice if they had more of\na selection?$
I beg your pardon?\nYou're looking for a ship?\pI'm sorry, the ferry service isn't\navailable at present…$
Hello, are you here for the ferry?\nMay I see your TICKET?$
{PLAYER} doesn't have the TICKET…\pI'm terribly sorry.\pYou must have a TICKET to board\nthe ferry.$
{PLAYER} flashed the TICKET.\pPerfect! That's all you need!\pAnd where would you like to go?$
Please sail with us another time!$
LILYCOVE CITY it is, then!$
BATTLE FRONTIER it is, then!$
Please board the ferry and wait for\ndeparture.$
Then, where would you like to go?$
A journey to the bottom of the sea…\nI wonder what it'd be like?\pI'd love to go deep underwater like\nthat someday.$
For a ship to sail safely, we need to\nknow about the weather!\pSpeaking of weather, I heard something\nfrom a guy at the WEATHER INSTITUTE.\pHe was saying abnormal weather has\nbeen reported all over the place!\pYou should visit the WEATHER INSTITUTE\nand ask around!$
I wanted to go with CAPT. STERN on\nthe ocean floor exploration.\pBut the sub's too small for me.\pIf I squeezed in, there wouldn't be\nany room for the CAPTAIN…$
CAPT. STERN: Those thugs…\pThey're the same lot who tried to rob\nthe DEVON GOODS at the MUSEUM.$
ARCHIE: Oh?\nNot you again…\pYou are tenacious to track us here,\nthat much I will give you.\pBut now…\nNo one can stop us! No one!\pOr, will you follow us back to our\nHIDEOUT in LILYCOVE CITY?\pFwahahahaha…$
CAPT. STERN: Why…\pWhy would TEAM AQUA steal my\nSUBMARINE EXPLORER 1?\pThey can't be after the slumbering\nPOKéMON at the bottom of the sea…\pBut even if I were to chase them,\nI don't stand a chance against them…$
CAPT. STERN: Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pOkay… So TEAM AQUA left before you\ncould stop them…\pOh, no, don't blame yourself.\nYou're not responsible for this.\pTrying to catch a submarine…\nIt's impossible for most people.\pYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE…\pPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY…\pA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you…$
CAPT. STERN: Trying to catch a\nsubmarine… It's impossible.\pYou would need a POKéMON that knows\nhow to DIVE…\pPerhaps if you went out to\nMOSSDEEP CITY…\pA lot of divers live out there, so\nsomeone might teach you…$
CAPT. STERN: Oh, yes.\nMR. BRINEY came to our SHIPYARD.\pIt won't be long now before we finish\nmaking the ferry!$
CAPT. STERN: {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pWe finally finished making the ferry\nS.S. TIDAL!\pWe couldn't have done it without\nyour friend MR. BRINEY.\pPlease go for a short cruise on it!$
CAPT. STERN: Oh?\n{PLAYER}{KUN}, that item you have…\pThat's a SCANNER! That would sure\nhelp us on our explorations.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, would you trade your\nSCANNER for something?\pLike, say, a DEEPSEATOOTH or\na DEEPSEASCALE that I have?$
CAPT. STERN: Are you certain?\nIt's useless to you, {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pWell, okay, then. If you want to trade\nyour SCANNER, let me know.$
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEATOOTH?$
CAPT. STERN: So you'll trade it for\nmy DEEPSEASCALE?$
CAPT. STERN: Which one do you want?$
{PLAYER} handed the SCANNER to\nCAPT. STERN.$
CAPT. STERN: Thanks, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nThis will help our research a lot!$
Hi, hi! I'm the NAME RATER!\nI'm the fortune-teller of names!\pI shall be pleased to rate your\nPOKéMON's nickname.$
Which POKéMON's nickname should\nI critique?$
Hmmm… {STR_VAR_1}, is it? That is\nquite a fine name you bestowed.\pBut! What say you, if I were to\nsuggest a slightly better name?$
Ah, good. Then, what shall the new\nnickname be?$
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as {STR_VAR_1}!\pIt is a better name than before!\nHow fortunate for you!$
I see.\nDo come visit again.$
Done! From now on, this POKéMON\nshall be known as {STR_VAR_1}!\pIt looks no different from before,\nand yet, this is vastly superior!\pHow fortunate for you!$
Hmmm… {STR_VAR_1} it is!\pThis is a magnificent nickname!\nIt is impeccably beyond reproach!\pYou'll do well to cherish your\n{STR_VAR_1} now and beyond.$
Now, now.\nThat is merely an EGG!$
My POKéMON has a HASTY nature.\pIt has higher SPEED compared to\nmy other POKéMON.\pMaybe their nature has something to\ndo with the stat gains of POKéMON.$
You're a TRAINER, aren't you?\pSince you came to SLATEPORT CITY,\nyou must be going to the BATTLE TENT.$
The MARKET does have some interesting\nmerchandise.\pBut there are some items you can only\nget at a POKéMON MART.$
A GREAT BALL is better than a POKé BALL\nat catching POKéMON.\pWith this, I should be able to get that\nelusive POKéMON…$
Welcome to the OCEANIC MUSEUM.\pThe entrance fee is ¥50.\nWould you like to enter?$
Please enjoy yourself.$
Oh? I'm sorry, but you don't seem to\nhave enough money.$
Oh? You're with that group that\nwent in earlier?\pYou're the only one who's late.\nYou'd better go catch up to them!$
We, TEAM AQUA, exist for the good\nof all!$
We were told to assemble here,\nso we did, but…\pOur BOSS, the linchpin, isn't here.$
If I ripped off the stuff here,\nwould it make me rich?$
What I learn here, I can put to use on\nnefarious deeds…$
If our goons didn't bungle things\nin RUSTBORO, we wouldn't be here!$
I didn't have ¥50, so it took a long\ntime getting by the receptionist.$
I want to learn about the sea and\nuse that knowledge for battling.$
I get all giddy and gooey when\nI see the sea!\pFor me, CAPT. STERN is the number\none role model!$
The sea is vast without end, and\ninfinitely deep…\pThere must be many POKéMON that\nwe don't know about.$
I want a sea POKéMON.\pI think it would feel cool and nice\nto hug.$
Aiyeeeh!\nWhat are you doing here?\pMe? I'm the TEAM AQUA member\nyou thumped before, remember?\lBack in RUSTURF TUNNEL?\pHere, take this!\nYou have to forgive me!$
That TM, it suits you more than it\ndoes me.\pHope I never see you again!\nWahahaha!$
Awww, come on!\nYou have to take this and let me go!$

CAPT. STERN: Wh-what?\nWho are you people?$
We're TEAM AQUA!\pOur BOSS wants those parts!\nShut your yap and fork them over!$

Oh, man, what a disaster…\nThe BOSS is going to be furious…$
Humph, sniveling wimp!\nLet me take care of this!$
What?!\nI lost, too!$
Now what? If we don't get the parts,\nwe're in for it!\pArrgh, I didn't count on being meddled\nwith by some meddling kid!$
I came to see what was taking so\nlong to snatch some parts, and you\lsimps are held up by a mere child?$

CAPT. STERN: You're…\nAh, okay, you're {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pAnyway, that was a tense situation!\nThank you for saving us!\pOh, yes, I almost forgot that you\neven brought the parts from DEVON!$
CAPT. STERN: Whoops!\nThere's no time to lose!\pWe have to set out on our ocean-floor\nexpedition really soon.\pThanks again, but now I've got\nto go!\pFeel free to wander around and check\nout our facilities, though.$

Want a tip for battling?\pI'd say it's raising different kinds\nof POKéMON in a balanced manner.\pIt's no good to make just one\nPOKéMON strong.\pIf it has a type disadvantage,\nit might not stand a chance.$
I trade POKéMON with my friends.\pIf a traded POKéMON is holding an\nitem, it makes me twice as happy!$
Er-hem! I am the CHAIRMAN of the\nPOKéMON FAN CLUB!\pBeing the CHAIRMAN, I am naturally\nthe most important!\pNo one can best me when it comes\nto raising POKéMON. No one!\pWell, let me tell you about\nPOKéMON CONTESTS.\pThey're events where one can show off\nPOKéMON for the world to see!\pHowever, they're held in far-off towns,\nso I cannot participate often enough.\pThat is why we gather here to show\noff our POKéMON, and have others\lshow us theirs.$
The POKéMON of a TRAINER who has\nentered a POKéMON CONTEST…\lThat, I would like to see.$
Er-hem! I see you've participated in\na POKéMON CONTEST!\pPlease! Allow me to examine how you\nhave raised your POKéMON.\pIt delights me no end to see POKéMON\nraised by other TRAINERS.\pThe happy expressions of POKéMON\nraised with proper care…\pThe kindly eyes of the TRAINER that\nnurtured and raised the POKéMON…\pThe very thought fills my heart to\noverwhelming with joy.\pOh! I do beg your pardon!\nForgive me for prattling on so!\pPlease! Allow me to examine how much\nyour POKéMON has grown!$
How is your POKéMON growing?\nAllow me to examine it.$
Hm, hm…\nI see…$
Hmmm… It's not bad, but it's not\ngood, either…\pYou, the TRAINER, must put more\neffort into raising this POKéMON!\pFor instance, may I suggest that\nyou give it more {POKEBLOCK}S?$
Oh, my…\pYour POKéMON is growing quite well,\nso you deserve a reward.\pUnfortunately, you have no space for\nthis in your BAG.$
Your {STR_VAR_1}, it is growing in\na most impressive manner!\lIt is one fine specimen!\pBut! If you were to give it this,\nit would grow even better! Indeed!$
Let a POKéMON hold that RED SCARF.\pEveryone will recognize the coolness\nof that POKéMON!$
Let a POKéMON hold that BLUE SCARF.\pIts beauty will be accentuated much\nmore than now!$
Let a POKéMON hold that PINK SCARF.\pIt will draw out the cuteness of\nthe POKéMON some more!$
Let a POKéMON hold that GREEN SCARF.\pThat will enhance the\nsmartness of POKéMON!$
Let a POKéMON hold that YELLOW SCARF.\pIt will bolster your POKéMON's\ntoughness so much more!$
I'm sorry, but I've nothing else to\ngive you! None at all!\pAfter all, you're blessed with the gift\nof raising POKéMON without resorting\lto any items!$
I love seeing POKéMON that love\ntheir TRAINERS.\pPOKéMON are very sensitive to\nthe feelings of their TRAINERS.\pIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.\pWhen your POKéMON grow to love you,\nplease come show me.$
Your POKéMON really adores you.\pFor you, a most compassionate\nTRAINER, a gift from the FAN CLUB!$
POKéMON are very sensitive to\nthe feelings of their TRAINERS.\pIf you treat your POKéMON with love\nand care, they'll love you back.$
If you keep letting a POKéMON faint\nin battle, it'll come to resent it.\pSoon, it will become less trusting\nof the TRAINER.\pIn other words, it certainly won't\nlike you very much.$
Do POKéMON enjoy having items used\non them?\pMine acted really happy when I gave\nit some PROTEIN.$
SKITTY: Fffnyaaaah…$
ZIGZAGOON: Kyuuu…$
AZUMARILL: Marimari?$
Umm… If this goes here, and that\ngoes over there…\pThen where does this thing go?\nAnd what about that doohickey?\pAaargh! I can't make heads or tails\nof this!$
Hm?\nHi, I'm DOCK.\pCAPT. STERN commissioned me to\ndesign a ferry.\pOh! That there…\nAre they DEVON GOODS?\pBut, hmm…\nThis won't do…\pCAPT. STERN went off somewhere.\nHe said he had some work to do.\pCould I get you to go find CAPT.\nSTERN and deliver that to him?$
DOCK: Where could CAPT. STERN have\ngone off to?\pCould you go find CAPT. STERN and\ndeliver that parcel to him?$
DOCK: Shipbuilding is an art.\pA lot of things can't be figured out\njust by calculating.\pI really could use advice from a veteran\nwho knows the seas…$
DOCK: Hi! MR. BRINEY's joined us to\nlend us his help.\pThanks to the veteran sailor, the\nferry is steadily coming together.$
DOCK: The ferry is finally ready!\pThe new S.S. TIDAL is truly a marvel\nof technology!\pBut, I get the feeling that we can\nmake something even better.\pYou know, there's never an end to\ntechnology's march.$
MR. BRINEY: Ah, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nIt's been too long!\pAye, since I met you, this old sea dog's\nbeen feeling frisky!\pSo I've decided to help DOCK make\na ferry.\pAye, after all, a ferry would be able\nto carry a lot of people.\pBut, you know, that DOCK is really\nsomething special.\pWith his knack for technology and\nmy experience, I'm sure that we can\lbuild one great ship, aye!$
The seasons, the weather, where\nthe moon sits in the sky…\pThese and other conditions make\nthe sea change its expression.\pThat's right!\nThe sea is like a living thing!$
I get seasick real easily.\nSo I get to help out here instead.$
Designing a large ship is more like\nmaking a big building than putting\ltogether a transportation vehicle.$
Don't you think it's strange that\na ship made of heavy iron floats?\pIt floats because of a principle\ncalled buoyancy.$
SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM\nLEADER: JUAN\p“The GYM LEADER with the beauty\nof pure water!”$
SOOTOPOLIS CITY\p“The mystical city where history\nslumbers.”$
The door is closed.$
Diving in the sea. Climbing up and\ndown stairs all the time…\pIf you live in this town, you end up\ngetting physically fit.$
These giant POKéMON suddenly appeared\nin the middle of the city!\pAnd, I've never seen them before!\pWhy are they smashing into each\nother like that?\pWhy can't they be friends, those\nPOKéMON?$
What? What? What?\nWhat is that green POKéMON?!$
GROUDON and KYOGRE…\nWhere did they go?\pWill they cause droughts or downpours\nsomewhere else?$
I just get this sense somehow that\nthe two POKéMON aren't angry.\pI think… They probably can't control\ntheir own power…$
That flying POKéMON came down from\nthe sky and stopped the rampaging\lPOKéMON…$
I… I've never been out of this city.\pI wonder what the world is like on\nthe other side of this round sky?$
Wow!\nThis is wicked!$
Wow!\nThat was wicked!$
Go for it, red POKéMON!\nDon't back off, blue POKéMON!$
… … … … … …\pHi, do you know the names of those\nPOKéMON fighting over there?$
I was wondering which one would win,\nthe red one or the blue one, but, oh no,\lit's the green one that settles things!\pTalk about a huge turn of events!$
There's an ancient legend that claims\nthe land and sea were shaped by\la colossal battle between POKéMON.\pWell, I'm seeing that happen with\nmy very own eyes!\pWhoa! I never expected to be\nwitness to something this huge!$
There's an ancient legend that claims\nthe land and sea were shaped by\la colossal battle between POKéMON.\pWell, I saw that happen with\nmy very own eyes!\pWhoa! I never expected to be\nwitness to something this huge!$
A big POKéMON is fighting with\nanother big POKéMON!\pPlease, someone make them stop!$
A pretty POKéMON came down from\nthe sky…$
Oh, no!\nSOOTOPOLIS CITY will get wrecked!$
SOOTOPOLIS CITY didn't get wrecked!$
Hm!\nYou've come all the way to SOOTOPOLIS?\lYou're no ordinary tourist.\pBut I suppose that doesn't make you\nan extraordinary tourist, either.$
The city has regained its calm…$
Who might you be?\pThis is the CAVE OF ORIGIN.\pThe spirits of POKéMON, becalmed at\nMT. PYRE, are said to be revived here.\pPlease leave.$
A person with a strong will and\nsuperior talent…\pA TRAINER who has knowledge and\nexperience of many kinds of POKéMON…\pIf such a person were to appear, I was\ninstructed by WALLACE to lead that\lTRAINER to this CAVE.$
Oh, my…\pThe clash between the two awakened\nPOKéMON was quelled by the awakening\lof a third POKéMON…$
This is the CAVE OF ORIGIN…\pWith the passing of the crisis,\nthe cave, too, shall sleep…$
SOOTOPOLIS sprang up as a town in\nthe crater of a volcano.\pIf you look up at the sky, the lip of\nthe crater is also visible.\lSo, all you see is the sky in a circle.\pBut that's what makes the sky above\nSOOTOPOLIS the most beautiful.$
When two POKéMON that gigantic\nare fighting that savagely, there's\lnot much that we can do.$
When that third POKéMON flew down,\nI feared the worst.$
A circle of a night sky framed by\nthe crater of a volcano…\pAnd in that ring, stars flicker and\nblink as if they were alive…\lIt's my favorite scenery.$
The weather was clear this morning,\nbut…\pAll of a sudden, dark clouds brewed up,\nrain started falling in sheets, and\lthere was thunder and lightning, too.\pThe weather just went completely\nwild!\pIs all of this because of those\nPOKéMON?$
Oh?\pIt was you who brought that flying\nPOKéMON here?\pWell, aren't you amazing!$
MAXIE: G… GROUDON…\nPlease! Stop what you're doing!\pI know the extent of your power now!\pIf you keep going, all HOENN, not just\nSOOTOPOLIS, will be utterly ruined!$
MAXIE: So the super-ancient POKéMON\nweren't only GROUDON and KYOGRE…\pAfter all our fruitless scheming and\nfrantic efforts, that one POKéMON's\lsimple action puts everything right\lagain as if nothing had happened…\pFu…\nFuhahaha…$
ARCHIE: KYOGRE! What's wrong?!\nLook over here! It's the RED ORB!\lCalm down! KYOGRE!\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pIt's no good!\nIt's not responding at all!$
ARCHIE: KYOGRE and GROUDON both\nflew off to who knows where.\pThe weather in HOENN has returned\nto its normal state…\pHaha…\nHahaha…\pMaybe what we were trying to do was\nsomething small, even meaningless,\lto POKéMON…$
STEVEN: Those POKéMON fighting…\nGROUDON… And KYOGRE…\pThe two super-ancient POKéMON\nwere awakened from a long sleep…\pAnd now they are smashing each other\nwith their uncontrollable energy…\p…{PLAYER}{KUN}.\pYou being here now I'll take to mean\nthat you're prepared to become\linvolved in this crisis.\pWell, then, there's someone that\nI'd like you to meet.\pCome with me, please.$
STEVEN: Listen, {PLAYER}{KUN}.\pDoes seeing GROUDON and KYOGRE make\nyou think POKéMON are to be feared?\pBut that's not true.\nPOKéMON are really more…\p…Why am I asking you this?\nYou already know.$
STEVEN: Okay, here we are!\pInside here you'll find someone named\nWALLACE.\pI think you have what's needed to\nhelp him…$
STEVEN: I think you have what's\nneeded to help him…$
STEVEN: The SKY PILLAR…\pI've never been there.\nI wonder where it could be?$
STEVEN: So that's RAYQUAZA…\pIt's incredible how the two rampaging\nPOKéMON would flee from it in fear…$
STEVEN: It looks like both MAXIE and\nARCHIE have gone away somewhere.\pPerhaps they've gone to MT. PYRE to\nreturn those ORBS…$
WALLACE: Oh?\n{PLAYER}{KUN}?\pHaven't you scaled the SKY PILLAR\nyet?\pI'm sure that you can make it to\nthe top of the SKY PILLAR…$
WALLACE: {PLAYER}{KUN}…\pThe leaders of TEAM MAGMA and AQUA,\nI don't think they meant harm.\pIt wouldn't hurt to hear what they\nhave to say for themselves.$
WALLACE: {PLAYER}{KUN}…\nMy eyes didn't deceive me.\pThanks to your help, SOOTOPOLIS…\nNo, all of HOENN was saved.\pOn behalf of the people, I thank you.\pThis is a gift from me.\nPlease accept it.$
That HIDDEN MACHINE contains\nWATERFALL.\pIf you have the RAIN BADGE, a POKéMON\nthat has learned that HM move can\lforce its way up waterfalls.\pAnd where does one get the RAIN BADGE?\nYou know, don't you?\pThat's right! You have to beat\nthe SOOTOPOLIS GYM LEADER.\pWhen you're all set to go, step through\nthat door.$
WALLACE: I'm sure that you will be\ndazzled by my mentor's breathtakingly\lelegant battle style.$
Yo! How's it going, CHAMPION-\nbound {PLAYER}?\pSOOTOPOLIS's GYM LEADER JUAN is\na master of WATER-type POKéMON.\pAnd, to get to JUAN, an icy floor\nwill hamper your progress…\pListen, I'm sorry, but that's all the\nadvice that I have for you.\pThe rest of the way, you have to\ngo for it yourself!$
Yow! You've beaten even JUAN, who\nwas supposedly the best in all HOENN!\pOkay! Check out your TRAINER CARD.\pIf you've gotten all the BADGES, you're\nset for the POKéMON LEAGUE challenge!$
Let me ask you.\nDid you know?\lAh, I should not be so coy.\pIt was I who taught WALLACE everything\nthere is to know about POKéMON.\pOnce, I had given up my position as\nthe GYM LEADER.\pIn my place, I had entrusted WALLACE\nwith the GYM.\pHowever, a compelling reason arose for\nme to make a comeback.\pAh, but enough chatter.\nLet us begin our match, shall we?\pPlease, you shall bear witness to\nour artistry.\pA grand illusion of water sculpted\nby POKéMON and myself!$
Ahahaha, excellent!\nVery well, you are the winner.\pFrom you, I sense the brilliant shine\nof skill that will overcome all.\pHowever, compared with me or even\nWALLACE, you are lacking in elegance.\pPerhaps I should make you a loan\nof my outfit?\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pHahaha, I merely jest!\pRather than my clothes, I shall reward\nyou with this, the RAIN BADGE!$
{PLAYER} received the RAIN BADGE\nfrom JUAN.$
Having the RAIN BADGE shall assure you\nthe full obedience of all your POKéMON\lto your every command.\pThe RAIN BADGE also allows the use\nof the HM move WATERFALL to scale\lwalls of cascading water.\pAnd, so that you never forget the\nbattle we shared, take this…$
The TECHNICAL MACHINE I handed you\ncontains WATER PULSE.\pIn use, it will occasionally confuse\nthe target with ultrasonic waves.\p… … … … … …$

The TRAINERS who have gathered all\nthe GYM BADGES of HOENN should make\lway to the ultimate destination.\pThe POKéMON LEAGUE.\pTravel to the easternmost reaches\nof HOENN, to the island EVER GRANDE.\pThere, you shall find the POKéMON\nLEAGUE.$
There remains but one BADGE to\nobtain in HOENN.\pIf you wish to challenge the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you must obtain the last\lBADGE from the GYM in FORTREE.$

SOOTOPOLIS CITY POKéMON GYM\pJUAN'S CERTIFIED TRAINERS:\n{PLAYER}$
JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its\nusual state of serenity…\pBut our young typhoon has returned\nto put us to the test again!\pWell, my friend, most certainly!\pI shall be delighted to dance with you\nas often as you wish!$
Ahahaha, you are the winner!\nYou have defeated me again!$
JUAN: If I told you to become my\napprentice, you will refuse, I am sure.\pI would like to make a gift of my coat\nto you.\pBut again, you will refuse.\nI imagine that to be so.\pAnd that, my friend, is a certain sign\nof nobility!$
JUAN: Ah, this GYM had returned to its\nusual state of serenity…\pBut our young typhoon has returned\nto put us to the test again!\pWell, my friend, most certainly!\nI shall be delighted to dance with you…\pAh, no, no, no.\nYou have with you but one POKéMON.\pI wish that you would return with\ntwo, perhaps more, POKéMON, please.$
I'll show you the sublime techniques\nI learned from our LEADER JUAN!$
Please forgive me, JUAN…$
Watch what happens if you crack all\nthe floor tiles.$
You came all the way here, but you won't\nget to see JUAN.\pNot if you lose to me, you won't!$
You're strong!\nI was fooled by your cute looks!$
You might be good enough to avoid\nbeing wiped out in one hit by JUAN.$
The sight of JUAN conducting\na battle…\pThe very beauty of it compelled me to\nbecome a TRAINER.$
You battled with more beauty than\nI could muster…$
The grace you bring to battle is\nfabulous.\pOh… I'm so fortunate to have found\nPOKéMON.$
I should teach you how harsh battles\ncan be.$
Oh.\nYou're strong.$
I'll tell you something good.\pIf you want to reach JUAN, you\nneed to walk on each floor tile once.$
The POKéMON GYM of the highest level\nin the HOENN region…\pThat's the SOOTOPOLIS GYM.$
What a high level you are!$
Rather than being satisfied by being\nin a strong GYM, I imagine training in\lother places will make you stronger.\lBut above all, it looks more fun.$
I train my POKéMON together with\nJUAN.\pDon't think I'm a pushover.$
I was beaten…$
I think you have potential.\nWhy don't you stay and train with us?$
A graceful glide across the ice while\ncrossing no lines…\pA TRAINER putting on that performance\nwould be elegantly beautiful!$
Well, excuse me?!$
This is really obvious, but how strong\nyou are as a TRAINER has nothing to do\lwith how young or old you are.$
When I'm with my POKéMON, the time\nflies by before you can say, “Oops!”$
Oops!$
I wish I could forget about lost causes\nbefore I can manage an “Oops!”$
I can battle with really rare POKéMON\nif you'd like.$
Oh, there now! Did you have a good look\nat my POKéMON?$
I came to this GYM because JUAN\npraised me for my darling POKéMON.\pOh, if only I'd met JUAN years ago\nwhen I was younger…$
Giggle…\nYour grim look is so charming.$
Oh, dear.\nI went much too easy on you.$
You couldn't lay a finger on JUAN,\nI'm sure. Giggle…$
For thirty years I've remained in\nSOOTOPOLIS honing my skills.\pI developed a shattering TM.\nI bequeath it to you!$
TM31 contains BRICK BREAK! It's a move\nso horrible that I can't describe it.$
KECLEON: Puu puhyaah.$
MT. PYRE…\pAt its peak are two orbs placed side\nby side. Did you know?$
Yes, two orbs side by side…\pThe sight of them together…\nIt is somehow soothing…$
Is that so?\nPerhaps you ought to visit and see…$
You're a POKéMON TRAINER, aren't you?\pSOOTOPOLIS's JUAN has many fans.\nEven more than his student WALLACE!\pDo you have any?$
Oh, then you must be pretty strong.$
Oh, dear…\nThat's a little lonesome.\pTry working a little harder to get\na fan following.$
Dedicated fans come over from even\noutside of HOENN.\pIt was really wild when I went to the\nTRAINER FAN CLUB in LILYCOVE.$
Listen up, and I'll tell you something\ngood.\pThere's supposed to be an ancient\nruin in the sea around here.\pThere could be treasures just waiting\nto be discovered down there.$
Ancient treasures…\pIt would be nice if they existed, but\neven if they didn't, it would be so\lbeautiful to take an underwater\lstroll with my POKéMON.$
AZUMARILL: Marurii.$
There appears to be some connection\nbetween SOOTOPOLIS and MT. PYRE.\pMy friends and I did some research on\nit at the lab where I used to work.$
My big brother used to study the sea.$
Hello! You're our first guest in\na good while.\pYou've brightened up my day, so I'll\ngive you a big WAILMER DOLL.$
Take good care of it!$
Oh, you want it, but not right now?\nOkay, then I'll hold it for you.$
Are you sure?\nYou don't want this DOLL?$
I love plush DOLLS!$
An underwater volcano erupted and\nforced itself up from the depths.\pIts crater emerged from the sea and\nbecame filled with rainwater.\pThat's how SOOTOPOLIS CITY came into\nbeing.$
The cave that links SOOTOPOLIS and\nthe outside world…\pIt seems as if the cave was made to\nkeep something from getting out.\pOr am I just imagining things?$
Do you know the POKéMON SEEDOT?\nIt's hardly ever seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\pAnyway, I love big SEEDOT.\nThe bigger the better.\pBut my younger brother, he says that\nLOTAD is bigger.\pThat's silly.\nSEEDOT has to be bigger than that!\pHuh? Do you have a SEEDOT with you?\nP-p-please, show me!$
{STR_VAR_2} inches!\nOh, my gosh, this is a big one!\pIt might even beat the big LOTAD\nmy younger brother saw!\pThanks for showing me.\nThis is my thanks!$
{PLAYER} received a POTION.$
Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.$
{STR_VAR_2} inches, is it?\pHmm… I've seen a bigger SEEDOT\nthan this one.$
Oh, now this is quite something…\nBut it's not a SEEDOT!$
You don't have a big SEEDOT?\nThat's too bad…\pIf you get a big SEEDOT, please\ncome show me.$
The biggest SEEDOT in history!\n{STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}-inch giant!\pA SEEDOT bigger than a LOTAD\nalways wanted!$
Do you know the POKéMON LOTAD?\nIt's rarely seen in SOOTOPOLIS.\pI love, I mean love, big LOTAD!\pMy big brother says that SEEDOT is\nbigger.\pBut that's wrong! Everyone knows that\nLOTAD is a lot bigger.\pHunh? Do you have a LOTAD?\nP-p-please show me!$
{STR_VAR_2} inches!\nWow, that is big!\pIt might be even bigger than the huge\nSEEDOT my big brother saw.\pThanks for showing me!\nThis is my thanks!$
{PLAYER} received a POTION.$
Hunh?\nYour BAG is crammed full.$
{STR_VAR_2} inches?\pHmm… I've seen a bigger LOTAD\nthan this one here.$
Well, isn't this something!\nBut it's no LOTAD!$
Don't you have a big LOTAD?\nHow disappointing…\pIf you get a big LOTAD, please\ncome show me!$
The biggest LOTAD in history!\n{STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}-inch colossus!\pA LOTAD bigger than a SEEDOT\nalways wanted!$
PP UP is great!\pIt raises the POWER POINTS, the PP,\nof a POKéMON move.$
What…\nWhat is happening?\pI really want to know, but it's too\nscary to go outside.$
Do you know FULL RESTORE?\pFull restoration of HP!\nEradication of all status problems!\pIt's truly an item of your dreams!$
This weather…\nDid something awaken?$
When I was young, I traveled the world\nas a POKéMON TRAINER.\pNow that I've become an old buzzard,\nmy only amusement is watching young\lTRAINERS battle.$
The door appears to be locked.$
A TRAINER named {STR_VAR_1}\nis visiting my home.\pWould you like to challenge\n{STR_VAR_1}?$
You won't battle? I'm disappointed\nthat I can't see you battle…$
Oh, good, good!\pBut my house isn't all that sturdy.\pCould I ask you to keep it down to\na 3-on-3 match?$
Before you two battle, you should\nsave your progress.$
I hope to see a good match!$
{STR_VAR_1}$
The match ended up a draw.$
So, it became a standoff.\pIt was a brilliant match in which\nneither side conceded a step!$
{STR_VAR_1}$
That was superlative!\pWhy, it was like seeing myself in\nmy youth again!$
{STR_VAR_1}$
Ah, too bad for you!\pBut it was a good match.\nI hope you can win next time.$
WALLACE is rumored to be the toughest\nTRAINER in the whole HOENN region.\pThis town's GYM is led by the TRAINER\nwho taught WALLACE.\pBut the ELITE FOUR… They're said to be\neven stronger than WALLACE's mentor.\pHow strong could they be?$
Everyone in town has taken refuge\nand won't come out of their homes.\pEven I would rather not venture\noutside.$
Whenever, wherever, and whatever\nhappens, I will always be friends with\lPOKéMON.\pBecause it's fun to be with POKéMON!$
Aren't POKéMON our friends?\pWhy are they going wild this way?$
This is the TRAINER HILL where\nyou may enjoy tag battles with many\lTRAINERS.\pUnfortunately, we're still getting\nthings ready. Please come back later!$
Welcome!\pThis is the TRAINER HILL where\nyou may enjoy tag battles with many\lTRAINERS!$
Is this your first visit here?\pBefore you enter, please save\nyour game.$
Let's see…\nThe TRAINERS here now are…\pUp to floor no. {STR_VAR_1}.$
Let's see…\nThe TRAINERS here now are…\pThere appear to be TRAINERS gathered\nin every room.$
Would you like to challenge the\nwaiting TRAINERS?$
I will time your progress.\nBest of luck!\pOn your marks…\pGet set…\pGo!$
Please do visit us again!$
That was too bad.\pI think you put in a tremendous\neffort in your battling.\pPlease come back and try again!$
I hope you give it your best.$
When the TRAINERS switch places,\nthe movement can be hectic.\pTo avoid the stampede, we moved\nthe reception counter here.\pI'm sorry for the inconvenience.$
Thank you for playing!$
Here at the TRAINER HILL, we conduct\nan event called the Time Attack.\pIt is a race that measures how long\nyou take to reach our owner on\lthe rooftop from this counter.\pThe fastest times are posted on\nthe Time Board--try competing with\lyour friends.\pIn TRAINER battles along the way,\nneither Exp.

Oh, I'm sorry, but you appear to have\nonly one POKéMON with you.\pYou will need at least two POKéMON\nto enter this event.$
Hm! Hm!\pYou finally came!\nYes, you have arrived!\pWait! Don't say it!\nI know why you came all the way\lhere by yourself!\pYou wanted to see me, the owner\nof the TRAINER HILL, because…\pYou want to form a tag team with me!\nWa-hoo!\p…Uh?\nThat's not it?\pAnyway, I watched you on your way up.\nMarvelous battling! Bravo, indeed!$
For a marvelous someone like you,\nI have the most marvelous gift!$
Oh, no, full up with things!\nYou'll be back later for this!$
Oh, hold on here! Did you possibly get\nhere marvelously quickly?\pHow splendid! You needn't have\nhurried so to see me!\pThat is so delightful. I'll have the Time\nBoard at the reception updated!$
But, oh…\nYou weren't very quick getting here.$
Perhaps it would please me more if you\narrived zippier next time.\pThen, I should be pleased to form\na tag team with you!\pUntil we meet again, amigo!$
I had the TRAINER HILL built for but\none reason and one only!\pTo find the most suitable partner\nwith whom I may form a tag team!$
{STR_VAR_1} min. {STR_VAR_2}.{STR_VAR_3} sec.$
Who knows what sort of TRAINERS\nand POKéMON combos are ahead?\pAll I know is that I'll knock aside\nanyone that stands in my way!$
I heard tough TRAINERS come to this\nTRAINER HILL from all over.\pI can't wait to test the waters!\pI'll knock aside anyone that stands\nin my way!$
Do you see the Time Board over there?\pMy friends and I are trying to see who\ncan reach the top in the least time.$
Do you know when they're opening\nthis place up?\pI'm waiting here to be the first\nchallenger ever!$
Would you like to return to\nthe reception counter?$
“SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1” is painted\non the hull.\pThis is the submarine TEAM AQUA\nstole in SLATEPORT!\pTEAM AQUA must have gone\nashore here.$
My papa told me.\pHe says this tunnel is full of\ntimid POKéMON.\pThey get all scared of loud noise and\nmake a big uproar.\pSo they had to stop the big tunnel\nproject.\pBut there's one man. He's trying to dig\nthe tunnel by himself!$
There was a man who dug a tunnel for\na lady he loved.\pI don't really get it, but hey!$
The way the winds blow, volcanic ash\nis never blown in this direction.\pThe air is clean and delicious here.\nLiving here should do wonders for even\lfrail and sickly people.$
My POKéMON and I, we've been riding\na hot winning streak.\pSo I decided to make my BATTLE TENT\ndebut in this town.$
Did you see the cave next to the\nPOKéMON MART?\pThere's a guy in there who's trying to\nbust up boulders so he can bust out\lthrough to the other side.\pIt'd be great if we could go through…\nIt'll make it easy to visit RUSTBORO.$
That cave next to the POKéMON MART\nis now a tunnel to the other side.\pIt's great--it's easy to go shop for\nnew DEVON products in RUSTBORO now.$

Which CONTEST are you entering?\nWant a piece of advice?\pIn any CONTEST, for example, a CUTE\nCONTEST, I don't think they judge you\lonly on cuteness in the first round.\pYou need to work out ways for raising\nPOKéMON better.$
I raised my POKéMON to be cute.\pI found out you can put POKéMON in\na CONTEST for cuteness!\pI'm so glad I raised my POKéMON with\nloving care…$

If it doesn't like a certain move,\na POKéMON will be reluctant to use it.\pIt doesn't matter how strong it is,\neither.\pFor example, a POKéMON with a GENTLE\nnature probably won't enjoy hurting\lits opponents.\pIf it can't seem to live up to its\npotential, it's probably failing at\lusing a disliked move against its will.$
My big sister is gentle usually.\nBut when she gets angry,\lshe's really, really scary!\pI bet a gentle POKéMON will be scary\nif it gets angry!$
My feelings toward my POKéMON…\nThe attraction runs deep…\pOh, hi, you didn't see that, did you?\nWell, it doesn't matter.\pHow would you like this TM for\nyour POKéMON?$
My feelings toward my POKéMON…\nI'm sure the attraction is mutual!\pThey battle exactly the way I want\nthem to!$
What kind of moves have you taught\nyour POKéMON?\pI think you would give yourself\nan advantage if they knew how to\lheal or protect themselves.$
SCOTT: Hey there, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nI thought I might see you here.\pA BATTLE TENT's a place where\nyou can meet tough TRAINERS.\pIt doesn't matter what the rules are,\nor how battles are waged, either.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, I expect you to do\nthe best you can!$

It seems to be very happy.\nIt obviously likes you a whole lot.$
It likes you quite a lot.\nIt seems to want to be babied a little.$
It's getting used to you.\nIt seems to believe in you.$
It's not very used to you yet.\nIt neither loves nor hates you.$
It's very wary.\nIt has scary viciousness in its eyes.\lIt doesn't like you much at all.$
This is a little hard for me to say…\pYour POKéMON simply detests you.\nDoesn't that make you uncomfortable?$
PIKACHU: Pika pika!$
Far away, deep in EVER GRANDE CITY,\nis the POKéMON LEAGUE.\pThe TRAINERS who gather there are\nall frighteningly well skilled.$
In the POKéMON LEAGUE, I think the\nrules say that you have to battle the\lELITE FOUR all in a row.\pIf you lose to any of them, you have\nto begin your challenge again from the\lfirst one.$
For any POKéMON match, X SPECIAL\nis crucial.\pIt jacks up the power of some moves\neven though it's only for one battle.$
They don't seem to sell any winning\nstrategy guides for the BATTLE TENT…\pIt seems one must rely on one's\nown wits after all…$

You can't consider yourself a real\nTRAINER if you don't have faith\lin your POKéMON.\pOnly those people who can believe\nin their battling POKéMON can win\lthrough to the very end.$
The reason why anyone would visit\nVERDANTURF…\pIt's the BATTLE TENT. It goes without\nsaying.\pOr is there somebody here that you\ncame to see?$
WALLY: I lost to you, {PLAYER}, but I'm\nnot feeling down anymore.\pBecause I have a new purpose in life.\nTogether with my RALTS, I'm going\lto challenge POKéMON GYMS and become\la great TRAINER.\pPlease watch me, {PLAYER}.\nI'm going to be stronger than you.\pWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.$
WALLY: Please watch me, {PLAYER}.\nI'm going to get stronger than you.\pWhen I do, I'm going to challenge you\nto another battle.$
UNCLE: Oh! {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nWALLY's next door.\pBut, boy, there's something I have to\ntell you.\pThis natural environment is doing\nwonders for WALLY's health.\pMaybe it's not just the environment.\nIt could be POKéMON that are giving\lthe boy hope.$
WALLY's gone away…\nHe slipped off on his own…$
UNCLE: Is that right?\nWALLY's gone away that far all by\lhimself…\pWell, I have to give him credit--he is\nmy little brother's son.$
WANDA: You are?\nOh, right, I get it!\pYou're the {PLAYER} who WALLY was\ntelling me about.\pI'm WALLY's cousin.\nGlad to meet you!\pI think WALLY's become a lot more lively\nand healthy since he came here.$
WANDA: Don't worry about WALLY.\nHe'll be just fine.\pI know my little cousin, and he has\nPOKéMON with him, too.$
Thanks to you, I can see my girlfriend\nevery day.\lHappy? You bet I am!$
My daughter's boyfriend is a very\ndriven and passionate sort of person.\pHe's been digging a tunnel nonstop\njust so he can see my daughter.\pMy daughter's a little concerned,\nso she goes out to the tunnel a lot.$
It's amazing. My daughter's boyfriend\nwas digging the tunnel by hand!\pIt's so incredible!$
If anything were to happen to WALLY,\nI would never be able to look his\lparents in PETALBURG in the eye…$
WALLY was in EVER GRANDE?\pHis parents in PETALBURG would be\nastonished to hear that!$
WALLY: Hi! {PLAYER}!\pI bet you're surprised to see me here!\pI made it all the way here, and it's\nall thanks to you!\p{PLAYER}, losing to you that time\nmade me stronger!\pBut I'm not going to lose anymore!\pI'm going to win! For the POKéMON who\ngave me courage and strength!\pOkay… Here I come!$
Wow!\n{PLAYER}, you are strong, after all!$
WALLY: I couldn't beat you today,\n{PLAYER}, but one of these days, I'll\lcatch up to you!$
WALLY: Hi! {PLAYER}!\pI've gotten stronger since that last\ntime! I wanted to show you, {PLAYER}!\pOkay… Here I come!$
Wow!\n{PLAYER}, you are strong, after all!$
WALLY: I couldn't beat you this time,\ntoo… But one of these days, {PLAYER},\lI'm going to catch up to you…\pAnd challenge the POKéMON LEAGUE!$
I've made it this far a couple times,\nbut the last stretch is so long…$
My dream ends here again…$
You've made it this far. Keep the\nmomentum going and become the\lCHAMPION! If anyone can, it's you!$
I didn't come all this way to lose now.\nThat possibility doesn't exist!$
Impossible…\nI lost?$
I lost here…\pThat means I lack the qualifications\nto become the CHAMPION…$
This seemingly infinite and harsh road\nlives up to its name of VICTORY.$
Your battle style is fantastic…$
You seem to have the potential for\nbecoming the CHAMPION.$
What is the VICTORY ROAD?\nI'll tell you if you win!$
Okay!\nWell done!$
Getting through here safely--that's\nthe final test for any TRAINER aiming\lto become the POKéMON CHAMPION.\pThat's why it's called the VICTORY\nROAD.$
I have nothing to say to anyone\nthat's come this far. Come on!$
This is a disgrace…$
Humph, go right on ahead.\nSee if I care.$
The thought that I'm getting closer to\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE…\pI'm getting stage fright…$
I couldn't do a thing…$
The POKéMON LEAGUE became distant\nagain… What a letdown…$
To win your way through the POKéMON\nLEAGUE, you need the trust of your\lPOKéMON.$
Your relationship is based on\nsolid trust.$
By being together all the time, trust\ngrows between POKéMON and TRAINERS.$
This isn't the goal. It's only a place\non the way to the POKéMON LEAGUE.$
That's the way!$
You'll do fine, for sure!\nYour POKéMON are all eager to go!$
My POKéMON are cosmically\nawe inspiring!$
I've never met anyone like you before.$
Even outside of battle, I sense\nincredible power emanating from you\land your POKéMON.$
Okay, no need to get your back up!\nRelax, let's take it easy!$
Whoa!\nWonderful!$
Sure, this is VICTORY ROAD.\pBut it's not all that different from\nthe path you've taken so far.\pTry to enjoy things the rest of\nthe way!$
I trained together with my whole family,\nevery one of us!\lI'm not losing to anyone!$
Better than my family?!\nIs that possible?!$
I was better than everyone in my\nfamily. I've never lost before…\pI've lost my confidence…\nMaybe I'll go home…$
I'd heard that there was a tough\nlittle kid around. Do they mean you?$
The little shrimp is tough!$
The rumors I heard, that tough little\nkid is from PETALBURG CITY.$
You must be getting a little tired.$
No signs of tiring at all!$
VICTORY ROAD and the POKéMON LEAGUE\nare long and grueling challenges.\lBeware of fatigue!$
You shouldn't get complacent just\nbecause you have a lot of GYM BADGES.\pThere's always going to be someone\nwho's better than you!$
You're better than me!$
Gaze on your collected BADGES and\nremember the TRAINERS you've faced.$
I've come this far, but the tension's\ngiving me awful stomach pain…$
Ooh…\nIt hurts…$
I can't help getting all tense knowing\nthat I'm nearing the POKéMON LEAGUE.\pIt's all I can do to feign calm.$
The elite among the elite gather in\nthis cave.\pHow are you finding it?$
Not rattled in the least bit!$
You do have guts! I like that!\nKeep it going!$

Um… Are you {PLAYER}?\nMy name is {STR_VAR_1}.\pI want to become a POKéMON TRAINER,\nbut I don't know what to do…\pSo I thought maybe I could ask you for\nadvice because you're so famous.\p{PLAYER}, could you give me advice?$
Oh, but…\pI sincerely want to become a POKéMON\nTRAINER!\pPlease, can you answer my questions?$
Thank you!\nHere's my first question right away!\pThe BATTLE TOWER has two levels,\nLevel 50 and Open Level, right?\pWhich level do you think is more\nsuitable for me?$

Oh? Huh?

I knew it…\pIt had to happen because I'm such\na really boring nobody…\pBut I thought just maybe…\nYou won't reconsider, will you?\pBut I can't give up just like that.\nI'll ask you while I'm still lucky!\pPlease, will you be so kind as to give\nme advice?$
Really? I can't believe it!\nI can't believe you'll advise me!\lI… I'm so happy…\pWhat I want to ask you is really\ntrivial, but I can't decide…\pAt the BATTLE TOWER, they let you\nchoose Level 50 or Open Level.\pWhich course do you think even I may\nhave a chance at?$
{STR_VAR_1}? Okay!\nBut do you really think someone like\lme would have a chance?\pI'll do my best, even though I don't\nthink it will work.\pThank you very much for spending\ntime with someone like me.$

Huh? Why are you refusing me?\nIt's me who's asking you!\lYou have to reconsider!$
Okay, so there is this something.\nI want you to decide it for me.\pYou know that the BATTLE TOWER has\nLevel 50 and Open Level Rooms?\pWhich do you think would be good\nfor me, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}?$

Uh-huh, {STR_VAR_1} it is!\nOK, A-OK!\lI'll go show my mettle, like, jam!\pAll right, I'll look to you as my mentor!\nAdios!$
Oh, hey, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, right?\nThe police were looking for you!\p… … …\nOf course I'm lying!\pMe, I'm {STR_VAR_1}. Despite the way\nI look, I'm the POKéMON CHAMPION!\l…That's a lie, too!\pThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at battling.\pSo, how about you becoming my master\nabout all things POKéMON?$
If you're going to act cold like that,\nI'll show you what I'll do!\pWaaah! Waaah! Waaah!\nHiccup!\pHahaha, that was my FAKE TEARS!\pCome on, will you please be\nmy POKéMON master?$
Yippee!\nI'll buy you a boat for that!\pOf course I'm lying again!\nBut… Thank you, master!\pYou know how there's Level 50 and\nOpen Level at the BATTLE TOWER?\pI'm having trouble deciding which\nlevel I should challenge…\pCan you decide for me, master?$

Say, hey, aren't you {PLAYER}?\nWhat should I do? Talk to you?\lWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\p{PLAYER}, are you surprised at me?\nI'd better tell you who I happen to be!\p{STR_VAR_1} is what you can call me.\nThe brightest star in guitardom,\lthat's me!\pAre you receiving me?\nYou are receiving me!\pMy luck's at its best,\nI'll hit you with a request!\p{PLAYER}, let me be your underling!\nI want you to teach me everything!$
You're turning me down, then?\nI'll just have to ask you again!\p{PLAYER}, I beg to be your underling!\nI need you to teach me everything!$
Lucky, yeah, woohoo!\nShould I pop a question to you?\pSince we're near the BATTLE TOWER,\nhow about a question about its power?\pOf the choices you see,\nwhich is the right one for me?$

Oh, hi! You there!\nCan I get you to massage my shoulder?\p…Yes, there! That's it!\nOuch, ouch! Oooh, that feels great!\pMy name's {STR_VAR_1}.\nI take karate training, but my body's\lnot built to take the abuse…\pI decided I'll battle POKéMON and\ntoughen myself up.\pYou're {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, aren't you?\nThe POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMP?\pListen, can I get you to give me\nadvice?$
Oh, why?\pI won't be a big bother, I promise!\nPlease?$
Thank you. Mighty good of you!\n…Cough! Cough!\pOogh, I have to toughen up quick…\pI'll be heading off to the BATTLE TOWER\nright away, but what would be better\lfor me? Level 50 or Open Level?$
Hm, all right. That's {STR_VAR_1}.\nI'll go there right away.\pI hope I can keep hitting you up for\nhelp--after all, you're my mentor!$
Er… Um…\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}…?\pPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me all self-conscious.\pI… I'm {STR_VAR_1}.\pI'm really embarrassed to say this,\nbut I explore ancient ruins and such.\pI'm even more embarrassed to admit\nI'm interested in the BATTLE FRONTIER.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, you have a reputation as\na tough TRAINER…\pIt's hard for me to say this,\nbut I want to ask something.\pCould you become my teacher and\ngive me advice?$
Please don't brush me off like this!\nI can't live with the humiliation.\pPlease become my teacher!\nI need your advice!$
Th-thank you…\pBut please don't look at me like that.\nIt makes me all flustered.\pPlease, answer me without looking\nat my eyes.\pAt the BATTLE TOWER…\nWhich level should I attempt?$
Oh… Okay!\nI'll try my hand at that.\pI hope I can make a valiant challenge\nwithout getting all flustered…\pThank you, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\las helpful.$
Hm? You appear to be {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nBut are you really real?\pYou may call me {STR_VAR_1}.\pI have been toying with the idea of\napprenticing under a strong TRAINER.\pSo, I must say I'm lucky you came along!\n…You really are {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, yes?\pNo, no, if you are real, it's fine.\nI merely want you to recognize me\las your apprentice.$
Oh?\nBut what would compel you to refuse?\pI apologize for being skeptical about\nyour identity.\pPlease accept my apology and\naccept me as your apprentice.$
You really are accepting me?\nI don't wish to celebrate prematurely.\pIf it is true, I apologize.\nBut now, I need your advice.\pIf I were to enter the BATTLE TOWER,\nwhat would be worthy of me?\lLevel 50 or Open Level?$
{STR_VAR_1}?\nAre you certain?\pI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pI realize I can annoy, but it delights\nme that you have accepted me.\pLet us meet again!$
Sigh… Sob…\nOh, {PLAYER}!\pI'm all tangled up in a dilemma\nthat I can't decide.\pI can't decide what I should make\nmy {STR_VAR_1} hold.\pPlease tell me, {PLAYER}.\nWhat item should I make it hold?$
Oh, really? I shouldn't make\nmy {STR_VAR_1} hold anything?$
Oh, okay! I'm delighted it's settled!\nAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\pThank you so much!$
Oh, I'm so glad…\nI think I have that {STR_VAR_1}, too.\pI'm delighted it's settled!\nAwesome! Wicked! Awoooh!\pThank you so much!$
Waaaah! Please don't be mean!\pThat item {STR_VAR_1} was already\nrecommended to me before, sob…\pOr do you mean I shouldn't make\nmy {STR_VAR_2} hold anything?$
Yay! It's {PLAYER}!\nGreat! I wanted to ask you something!\pDo you make your POKéMON hold items?\nI want to make mine hold items, but…\pWhat item would be good for\n{STR_VAR_1} to hold?\pWhat do you think?$
Huh? You mean my {STR_VAR_1} doesn't\nhave to hold anything?$
Oh, I get it! I'll do that!\nThanks for teaching me!$
Oh, wow! One {STR_VAR_1}, huh?\nOkay, I'll do that!\pThanks for teaching me!$
Oh, uh, no, that's not what I meant.\nI want to know about a different item\lthan the ones I already know.\pOr do you mean that my POKéMON doesn't\nhave to hold anything this time?$
{PLAYER}, hello!\nIt's about my {STR_VAR_1}…\pI want to make it hold a good item.\nWhat would be good for it?$
Oh, then my {STR_VAR_1} doesn't have\nto hold anything?$
Okay, I got it!\nSee you again!$
Oh, the item {STR_VAR_1}?\nUnderstood!\pI'll do my best to find one!\nSee you again!$
Somebody taught me about\nthe {STR_VAR_1} already.\pI want my POKéMON to hold a different\nkind of item.\pOr do you think {STR_VAR_2} doesn't\nhave to hold anything?$
Hello, {PLAYER}…\nI'm sorry to disturb you, but I have\lsomething else I wanted to ask you.\pI don't think I'm good enough to win\nmatches on my own, so I'm thinking of\lmaking my {STR_VAR_1} hold an item.\pBut I don't know what would be good.\p{PLAYER}, please, could you decide\nfor me?$
A POKéMON belonging to someone like me\nwould be better off without an item?$
I understand…\nYou're saying I shouldn't rely on items.\lI'll do my best not to!\pThank you very much!$
The item {STR_VAR_1}, okay.\nI'm not sure if I can get one…\lNo! I'll do my best to get it.\pThank you very much!$
Oh, but…\nI think I've heard about that before…\pIs it maybe because I haven't handled\nthe item {STR_VAR_1} very well?\pOr do you mean I shouldn't make\nmy {STR_VAR_2} hold anything?$
Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nThere's something I wanted to ask you.\pYou know how you decided which\nPOKéMON I should have for me?\pBut I never asked you what item\nit should be holding.\pSince you already gave me advice,\nhow about seeing this to the end?\pWhat would be good? I want to make\nmy {STR_VAR_1} hold something.$
Oh! So my {STR_VAR_1} should do\nthe best it can empty-handed?$
If you think that's best, I'll do that.\pKnowing that you made the decision,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, I won't be so upset if\lI lose.\pOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!$
The item {STR_VAR_1}, huh?\nNot bad. I'll use it!\pKnowing that you made the decision,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, I won't be so upset if\lI lose.\pOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!$
Huh? What are you saying?\nYou told me about the {STR_VAR_1}\lalready before.\pOr do you mean my {STR_VAR_2} should\ndo the best it can empty-handed?$
Yo, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pWe're both busy, but we seem to run\ninto each other often anyway!\pToday I have to do some walking,\ncleaning, and brushing.\pI haven't even had the time to buy\nmy precious {STR_VAR_1} anything.\pI don't have any time, so how about\ngiving me advice on what I should make\lmy {STR_VAR_1} hold?$
Oh, so me being a busy guy, you say\nmy {STR_VAR_1} doesn't need anything?$
Okay, gotcha.\nI won't need any time for that.\pThanks today!\nSee you around!$
Okay, gotcha.\nI'll find time somehow and find\lthat {STR_VAR_1} you recommended.\pI'm glad I met a good mentor in you.\nThanks! See you around!$
Huh? I already know about\nthat {STR_VAR_1}.\pOh, right, I get it.\nSo me being a busy guy, you say\lmy {STR_VAR_2} doesn't need anything?$
Hiya, {PLAYER}! It's me!\nI need to tap your mind again today.\lPlease, I need your advice!\pDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\pIf I want to make my {STR_VAR_1} hold\nan item, what should it be?$
Is that right? My {STR_VAR_1} doesn't\nneed to hold an item, you're saying.$
Okay, that's what I'll do!\pI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\pLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!$
Uh-huh! One {STR_VAR_1}.\nWhat a cool choice!\lI'll definitely try that!\pI guess that's about all I wanted\nto ask you today.\pLet's meet here again, okay?\nThanks!$
Ahahah! That's silly!\nYou already told me about that\l{STR_VAR_1} before!\pAre you feeling okay, {PLAYER}?\pOh, wait! My {STR_VAR_2} doesn't\nneed to hold an item, you're saying.$
Hello, {PLAYER}. I hope you've been\nkeeping well.\pMay I approach you for advice?\pIn a recent battle, my opponent\nseemed to have given his POKéMON\lan item to hold.\pAs a result, I was defeated…\pI don't wish to be left behind.\nI would like to make my {STR_VAR_1}\lhold an item, too.\pIt would please me if you could decide\nwhat would be right for my POKéMON…$
In other words… My POKéMON has\nno need to hold an item?$
I understand clearly now!\nI will keep trying like this.\pThank you, {PLAYER}.\nI hope I can count on you again.\lPlease take care!$
One {STR_VAR_1} it is!\nI will order it right away.\pThank you, {PLAYER}.\nI hope I can count on you again.\lPlease take care!$
You've already told me about that,\nand I already have it.\pOr are you saying… My POKéMON has\nno need to hold an item?$
Eek! {PLAYER}!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you again!\pOh-oh-oh! There's something I just\nhad to ask you, {PLAYER}!\pPlease decide what my {STR_VAR_1}\nshould be holding!$
Oh, wow! I didn't expect that answer!\nSo, a hold item isn't necessary?$
Perfectly understood!\nI'll keep at this without an item!\pI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.$
{STR_VAR_1}! I'll use that!\pUm… Could it be, {PLAYER}, you also\nmake your POKéMON hold that item?\pI'll be sure to get it!\nI hope you'll be willing to teach me\lsome more another time.$
Oh? You recommended that\n{STR_VAR_1} before, too.\pOr is it the best thing to hold?\nOr do you mean that my {STR_VAR_2}\ldoesn't need anything to hold?$
Hola!\nMy maestro, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pI want to hit you up for advice on\nPOKéMON tools.\pWhat do you think would be good for\nmy {STR_VAR_1} to hold?\pDon't be shy now.\nLet's blurt it out!$
Oh? So, you're saying my {STR_VAR_1}\ncan win without holding any item?$
Si, bueno!\nI'll give it my best shot, like, slam!\pAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!$
Uh-huh, that's one {STR_VAR_1}?\nSi, bueno!\lI'll go find me one, like, bam!\pAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!$
No, no! You already told me about\nthat {STR_VAR_1} thing before.\pOh, now wait just one minute here…\nSo, you're saying my {STR_VAR_2}\lcan win without holding any item?$
{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, something unbelievable\nhas happened!\pI woke up this morning, and my POKéMON\nhad 10 NUGGETS!\pOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\pThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at thinking about\lwhat items POKéMON should hold.\pSo, how about deciding for me what\nmy {STR_VAR_1} should hold, master?$
What's that mean?\nDon't make it hold anything?$
Okay, so it shouldn't hold anything.\nThen, I'd better get something for it!\pJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\pThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!$
Okay, so it's one {STR_VAR_1}!\nI'll make it hold anything but that!\pJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\pThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!$
Um, you told me about that before,\ndidn't you?\pIsn't there something else?\pOr do you mean, don't make\nmy {STR_VAR_2} hold anything?$
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\pThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI present to you a question\lthat's pretty fly!\pIt's an item question\nthat begs your suggestion!\pMy {STR_VAR_1} needs an item to hold,\nWhat should it be, if I may be bold?$
Is that right?\nMy {STR_VAR_1} doesn't need to be\lholding anything tight?$
Okay, I hear you, sure I do!\nMy POKéMON will go empty-handed, too!\pIf it's advice I ever need,\n{PLAYER}, your word I'll always heed!$
Okay, one {STR_VAR_1},\nthat's what I'll use.\lI was right to make you choose!\pIf it's advice I ever need,\n{PLAYER}, your word I'll always heed!$
Okay, one {STR_VAR_1}, you say?\nYou told me that the other day.\lI need a new idea, a brand new way.\pOr, what, is that right?\nMy POKéMON doesn't need to hold\lanything tight?$
Say, hey, {PLAYER}!\nI found you again today!\pWhat should I do? Get your advice?\nWhy not? I'm already talking to you!\p{PLAYER}, are you getting sick of me?\nNah, no way, that can't be.\pWill you hear me out?\nI'm looking for advice--that's what\lI'm talking about.\pIt's about a hold item for\nmy {STR_VAR_1} that'd be good.\lMy indecision is making me brood.$
My {STR_VAR_1} needs nothing?\nDoesn't need to hold anything?$
If holding nothing is the best,\nI'll do as you suggest!\pWell, {PLAYER}, I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\pSee you again, my smart friend!$
If holding that {STR_VAR_1} is\nthe best, I'll do as you suggest!\pWell, {PLAYER}, I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\pSee you again, my smart friend!$
Haven't I heard about that\n{STR_VAR_1} before?\lI'm certain I have, that's for sure!\pI need a new something!\nOr, my {STR_VAR_2} needs nothing?\lDoesn't need to hold anything?$
Gwah! Ouch! {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, my arm's broken!\nDon't touch it, please!\pI must've broken it while I was trying\nout different hold items with my posse\lof POKéMON.\pSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, what do you think would be\ngood for my {STR_VAR_1} to hold?$
Ouch…\pSo your suggestion is my {STR_VAR_1}\ndoesn't have to hold anything?$
Hm, all right. That would be easier\nfor me, the way things are now.\pI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.$
Hm, all right. That's one {STR_VAR_1}.\nMy POKéMON's arm is fine, so I'll make\lit hold that item right away.\pI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.$
No, no, you told me about that\n{STR_VAR_1} before, remember?\pHow about telling me something\neven better?\pOh, wait a second.\nSo your suggestion is my {STR_VAR_2}\ldoesn't have to hold anything?$
Er… Um…\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\pPlease, don't look at me that way.\nMy POKéMON don't have anything.\pI… I'm really embarrassed about this,\nbut I really need your advice.\pI can't decide what hold item would\nmake my {STR_VAR_1} strong.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, what do you think would\nbe good?$
Oh… Then, you think it would be better\nif my {STR_VAR_1} didn't have an item?$
Oh… Okay!\nI'll go without an item.\pThis is nerve-racking, though.\nWouldn't it be too cool?\pThank you, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\las helpful.$
Oh… Okay!\nI'll go with that {STR_VAR_1}.\pThis is nerve-racking, though.\nWouldn't it be too cool?\pThank you, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\las helpful.$
B-but I already heard about that.\pPlease don't brush me off like this!\nI can't live with the humiliation.\pOh… Am I jumping to conclusions?\nDo you think it would be better if\lmy {STR_VAR_2} didn't have an item?$
Hm? You appear to be {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nBut are you really?\lPerhaps you're a twin?\pOh, no, no, no, don't worry!\nIf you really are {PLAYER}, please\lforget about my rudeness.\pWhat I would like is some more of\nyour fine advice.\pI have here my {STR_VAR_1} that I wish\nto make hold a convenient item.\pWhat would be worthy of it?$
It's better if it held nothing?\nAre you certain?$
I see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pLet us meet again!$
One {STR_VAR_1}?\nAre you certain?\pI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pI do hope my POKéMON will be able to\nput it to good use.\pLet us meet again!$
No, no, wait a minute.\nI believe you taught me that before.\pI would like you to recommend\nsomething different this time.\pPerhaps you're suggesting that\nmy {STR_VAR_2} should hold nothing?\lAre you certain?$
Waah, {PLAYER}!\nI have a dilemma, sob…\pI want to begin battling other people,\nbut I don't know what to do.\pHow should I line up my POKéMON\nso they'll be at their strongest?\pPlease tell me, {PLAYER}.\nIf you were me, which of these POKéMON\lwould you send out first?$
My {STR_VAR_1} should go first?\nWaaaaah!\pOh! I'm so sorry!\nYou've made me happy by choosing\lmy first POKéMON, and it's made me cry…\pThank you so much!$
Yay! It's {PLAYER}!\nGreat! I wanted to ask you something!\pUm, of my POKéMON, which do you\nthink should go out first?$
My {STR_VAR_1}? That's true.\nOkay, I'll do that!\pThanks for teaching me!$
{PLAYER}, hello!\pI think, in a battle, it's very important\nwhich POKéMON comes out first.\pOut of the POKéMON that I have,\nwhich would be good to send out first?$
My {STR_VAR_1} goes first?\nOkay, I got it!\pSee you again!$
Hello, {PLAYER}…\nI'm sorry to disturb you again with\lanother question.\pI have so little confidence, I don't\nknow what I'd do without you, {PLAYER}.\pIt may be a waste of time for me to\neven worry about it, but I just can't\ldecide something…\pWhich of my POKéMON should I send\nout first in a battle?$
My {STR_VAR_1}?\nUnderstood!\pI can't believe that you would bother\nto answer my questions so often!\pI'm so grateful that you would even\nspeak with me… Thank you!$
Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}! It's me!\nI'm so glad to see you because I have\lthis little problem.\pI can't decide how my POKéMON should\nbe lined up. Could you decide for me?\pOh, you don't need to decide the whole\nparty right now.\pHow about deciding just the first\nPOKéMON for me?$
My {STR_VAR_1}? That's great!\pKnowing that you made the decision,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, I won't be so upset if\lI lose.\pOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!$
Hi, my teacher {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\nI'm busy again today!\pI have to do some cycling, shopping,\nand humming.\pI haven't even had the time to decide\nhow to line up my POKéMON team.\pSo, how about checking out my team?\nWhich one should go first?$
Okay, gotcha.\nI have enough time at least to put\lmy {STR_VAR_1} at the head of the line!\pWhoops, my girlfriend's waiting!\nThanks! See you around!$
Yoohoo! Hiya, {PLAYER}!\nYou always walk around looking tough!\pListen, I need something from you\nagain! It's the usual thing!\pDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is about my team.\pWhich POKéMON of mine should be first\nto go out in a battle?$

Eek! {PLAYER}!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you again!\pMy POKéMON have become much\nstronger!\pBut I don't always win. It seems to\ndepend on which POKéMON goes first.\p{PLAYER}, please, I need your help!\pPlease decide which of my POKéMON\nshould go out first!$
Sigh… I'm overwhelmed with happiness…\pIt's like a dream having you decide\nfor me, {PLAYER}.\pBut perfectly understood!\nI will go with my {STR_VAR_1} first!\pI hope you'll be willing to teach me\nsome more another time.$
Hello, hello!\nMy mentor, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\lHit me with your sage advice today!\pYou see, I pulled together a team of\nthree POKéMON.

Uh-huh, my {STR_VAR_1} leads off!\nOK, A-OK!\lI'll reorder the lineup, like, wham!\pAll right, thanks, as always!\nAdios!$
{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, listen!\nIt's a crisis!\pMy POKéMON, all three of them, go into\nbattle at once!\pOf course that's impossible!\nWahahaha!\pThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at thinking about\lhow I should line up my POKéMON.\pSo, how about deciding for me which\nPOKéMON should go first, master?$
Okay, so it's my {STR_VAR_1} you chose?\nI'll let any but that one go first!\pJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\pThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!$
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\pThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI present to you a question\lthat's pretty fly!\pIt's a team lineup question\nthat begs your suggestion!\pOut of this lot, which should go first\nas the first on the spot?$

…Oof…ooch… {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nMy stomach's hurting all of a sudden…\p…It's getting better now…\pI must've worried myself sick racking\nmy brains on how I should line up\lmy posse of POKéMON.\pSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, which of my POKéMON should\ngo first? So I'd win, I mean.$
Hm, all right.\nMy {STR_VAR_1} goes first.\pI'll fix the lineup like that after\nI have my supper.\pI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.$
Er… Um…\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}?\pPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me feel all flustered.\pUm…\nI really need your advice.\pIt makes me bashful to say this,\nbut I chose my 3-POKéMON team.\lI can't decide on the order, though.\pWhich POKéMON should I send out first\nso I at least look capable?$

Hello, {PLAYER}…\pUm, you've probably already forgotten\nabout someone like me…\p…But that doesn't matter if you\ncould give me advice…\pI can't decide on the one kind of\nPOKéMON I should raise…\pI've narrowed the field to the POKéMON\n{STR_VAR_1} and {STR_VAR_2}, but that's\lwhere I became stuck…\p{PLAYER}, you probably don't want to\nbother, but please decide for me.$

{STR_VAR_1}?\nAre you certain?\pI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pI do hope it is something even I can\nhandle with aplomb.\pLet us meet again!$

{PLAYER}, hello!\nIt's about my {STR_VAR_1}, but I'm\lworried about its moves.\pYou see, it's the moves {STR_VAR_2}\nand {STR_VAR_3}.\pWhich is stronger and better for\nmy {STR_VAR_1}?$

Ohhh, {PLAYER}…\nI'm hopeless, no, really!\pI've decided to raise a POKéMON,\nbut now I can't even decide what\lmove I should let it learn…\pI know that it doesn't mean anything\nto you, {PLAYER}.\pBut it means a lot to me…\pPlease, {PLAYER}, could you choose\na move for my {STR_VAR_1}?\pIf you could even choose between\n{STR_VAR_2} and {STR_VAR_3}…$
I understand!\pBut will it even be willing to learn\n{STR_VAR_1} for me…\lNo! I'll do my best!\pThank you!$
Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\nI was just hoping to see you, too!\pI was wondering what move would\nbe suitable for my {STR_VAR_1}.\pI can't decide, so can you decide\nfor me instead?\pFor instance… How about the moves\n{STR_VAR_2} and {STR_VAR_3}?\lWhich one would be better?$
{STR_VAR_1}? That's great!\pKnowing that you made the decision,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, I won't be so upset if\lI lose.\pOkay, I'll look to you for advice again.\nBye!$
How could things be this busy?\nHey, if it isn't {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\lHow's it going?\pSince I got up this morning, I've done\nmy jogging, swimming, and cooking!\pYou wouldn't believe how busy I am!\pI can't even decide what move\nmy {STR_VAR_1} should learn!\p{STR_VAR_2} looks good, huh?\nBut {STR_VAR_3}'s also decent.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, give me some of your good\nadvice! Which move'd be good for me?$
Okay, gotcha.\nI'll make room in my schedule and\lteach that move.\pI'm glad I met a good mentor in you.\nThanks! See you around!$
Oh! Lucky!\nI met you again, {PLAYER}!\lI need to tap your mind again today.\pDrum roll, please!\nThe question I have is…\pFor my {STR_VAR_1}, which is the move\nbest suited, {STR_VAR_2} or\l{STR_VAR_3}?$

{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, it's completely wild!\pMy POKéMON!\nIt learned six moves!\pOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\pThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at choosing moves\lfor my POKéMON.\pSo, how about deciding for me which\nkind of move I should teach?\p{STR_VAR_2} or {STR_VAR_3}--which\nwould go with my {STR_VAR_1} best?$
Okay, so it's {STR_VAR_1} you chose?\nI'll choose another move, then!\pJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\pThanks, master!\nI hope you'll keep teaching me!$
A-H-O-Y!\nAnd that spells ahoy!\pThe rappin' SAILOR am I!\nI'm always with it, don't ask me why.\pToday, I have a move question\nthat begs your suggestion!\p{STR_VAR_2} and {STR_VAR_3} are\nthe moves. What would be the best\lfor my {STR_VAR_1} so it grooves?$

If that {STR_VAR_1} is the best,\nI'll do as you suggest!\pWell, {PLAYER}, I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me.\pSee you again, my smart friend!$
Gahack! Gaah! Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nI have this lousy cold, I do…\pI want to pick a move for my POKéMON,\nbut I'm not up to it…\pSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me.\p{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, if I had to choose between\n{STR_VAR_2} and {STR_VAR_3} for\lmy {STR_VAR_1}, which would it be?$
Hm, {STR_VAR_1}, all right. Cough!\nI'll go teach it when I get better.\pI hope I can keep hitting you up\nfor help like this.$
Er… Um…\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}…?\pPlease, don't look at me that way.\nI'm getting all flustered…\lI… I need your advice.\pI… I'm really embarrassed, but I can't\ndecide what move I should teach\lmy POKéMON.\pIt's for my {STR_VAR_1}.\nIf the choices were {STR_VAR_2} or\l{STR_VAR_3}, which would be better?$
Oh… Okay!\nI'll try that {STR_VAR_1}.\pI hope I can teach that move…\nThis is so nerve-racking…\pThank you, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nIf we meet again, I hope you will be\las helpful.$

You appear to be {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nBut are you really real?\pPerhaps you're one of those popular\nmimics?\pNo, no, if you are real, it's fine.\nNo need to be upset, I assure you!\pIncidentally, I would like to obtain\nyour advice.\pIt's about my {STR_VAR_1}.\pWhich move would be better for it to\nuse, {STR_VAR_2} or {STR_VAR_3}?$
{STR_VAR_1}?\nThere's no question about that?\pI see. If that's the case, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pI do hope it is something even\nmy POKéMON can learn.\pLet us meet again!$

Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nThere's something I want you to hear.\pI know that I don't always sound\nnice or polite…\pWhen I win a battle, I think I come\nacross as being arrogant.\pI don't want people to dislike me,\nso I want to say something nice to\lsomeone I beat.\pBut I can't think of anything good!\nCould you think something up for me?$
{STR_VAR_1}\pNot bad!\nYup, that's what I'll go with!\pI'm going to hit the road and do what\nI can with what you taught me in\lmy head and heart.\pI'm sorry that I've been so pushy\nwith you!\pNext time, we battle, okay?\nSee you!$

Why am I so busy?\pBut even though I'm busy, it'd be rude\nto just turn on my heels and walk away\lfrom a win without saying a word.\pSo, what would be a cool saying to\nunderline my coolness when I'm done\land walking away? {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, help me!$
{STR_VAR_1}\pOkay, gotcha.\nI can find time to say that!\pHonestly, I'm glad I met a good mentor\nlike you.\pI'm going to make time somehow so\nI can get into battling.\pThanks for everything, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\nWe have to battle, you and me, one day!$
I lucked out again!\n{PLAYER}! Am I glad to see you!\lLike usual, I need your advice!\pDrum roll, please!\nThe last question I have is…\pIf I win a battle and want to end\nit with a cool flourish, what\lshould I say?$
{STR_VAR_1}\pThat… That's fabulous!\nIt's dignified and cool! I claim it!\p…Listen, I think I'm getting decent\nat this, huh?\pSo, I'm thinking of challenging other\nTRAINERS from now on.\p{PLAYER}, your advice really helped me.\pMaybe one day, there'll be a time when\nwe battle!\pThank you for everything!$
Oh, {PLAYER}.\nI'm so glad I met you!\pI no longer have any concerns with\nregard to my POKéMON.\pIt's myself that worries me…\pDo you know how a TRAINER says\na few things upon winning a battle?\pDefinitely, I wish I could do that,\ntoo!\pPlease, what should I say when\nI win a battle?$
{STR_VAR_1}\pAh! That saying! It refreshes me\nand makes me feel reborn!\pI must use that right away!\pAnd now, I must take my leave,\n{PLAYER}…\pI will go out to battle many others,\nbut never will I forget your teachings.\pPerhaps one day…\nFarewell!$
Eek! I spotted {PLAYER}!\nI… I'm overjoyed to see you!\pOh-oh-oh!

{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, there's big trouble!\pWhen I win a battle, I brag about it\nfor an hour at least!\pOf course I'm lying!\nWahahaha!\pThis is no lie, though.\nI'm not very good at chatting.\pSo, how about deciding for me what\nI should say after winning a battle,\lmaster?$
{STR_VAR_1}\pThat's what I should say, huh?\nThen, I'll stay away from that!\pJust kidding!\nI'll obey your teaching, master!\pThanks for teaching me all this time,\nmaster!\pI'm finally understanding what being\na TRAINER is about.\pI'm going to go out and win battles\nagainst any TRAINER.\pMaybe it'll be you one day, master!\pThat's all!\nFarewell, my master!$

{STR_VAR_1}\pPerfect! That's what I'll use.\nI was right to make you choose!\pAnd now, I think it'd be best,\nif I were to fly the nest!\pThanks for all you taught me.\nI'll be off on a battle spree!\pB-O-N-V-O-Y-A-G-E!\nAnd that spells bon voyage,\lto you this is my homage!$
Oh, yeah, {PLAYER}!\nI found you again today!\pWhat should I do? Ask you again?\nWhy not? I'm already asking you!\pAnyways, {PLAYER}…\nAre you receiving me?\lYou are receiving me!\lI need some more advice for me!\pIt's about what I should yell.\nSomething cool to holler when\la battle ends well.\pCome on, I wanna hear you say it!$
{STR_VAR_1}\pAll right, all right!\nI'll use that because it's so tight!\pI'm out of things to ask you.\nWaving bye is all that's left to do.\pBut maybe one day we'll meet, with one\ndestined to go down in defeat.\pBut, it really is time to say farewell.\pWell, {PLAYER}, I have to roam free,\nbut don't you forget about me!\pTake care, {PLAYER}!\nLove ya!$
{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, I'm finished…\nMy nose won't stop dripping…\pI was trying to think up something\ncool to say when I win a battle.\pIt inspired me so much, it made me cry,\nand now my nose won't stop running…\pSo, things being this way,\nI need you to decide for me, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\pWhen I win a battle,\nwhat should I say?$
{STR_VAR_1}\p… … …That's good.\nNo, it's awe inspiring!\lIt's bringing fresh tears to my eyes!\pBut in spite of my tears and runny\nnose, I will use that saying!\pI'm plumb out of things to ask you,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\pFrom now on, we're rivals!\nThanks for everything!$
Er… Um…\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\pPlease, don't look at me that way.\nYou're making me all nervous.\pI… I need your advice again.\nI'll make it my last, though…\pIt's really embarrassing to ask,\nbut what if I win a battle?\lWhat should I say?$
{STR_VAR_1}\pOh… Okay!\nI'll try to say that!\lI might be too nervous to say it…\pThank you, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\nI have to say good-bye now.\pI'll obey all that you've taught me,\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}, and do the best I can.$
Hm? You appear to be {PLAYER}{STRING 5}…\nBut are you really?\lPerhaps a clever {PLAYER} DOLL?\pOh, no, no, no, don't worry!\nIf you really are real, please\lforget about my rudeness.\pNo need to be so angry. All I wish for\nis more of your fine advice.\pIt concerns a saying.\pMore precisely, what should I say\nif I win a battle?$
{STR_VAR_1}\p… … … … … …\nWhen I win a match…\p{STR_VAR_1}\p…Are you serious?\pI see. If you are serious, that's fine.\nI thank you for your time.\pI do hope even I will be able to\nput that saying to good use.\pI seem to have run dry on what advice\nI need.\pI do believe it's high time I bid you\nfarewell and strike out on my own.\pThank you, my mentor!\nI apologize for my skepticism!$

Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\pIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any {POKEBLOCK}S.$
Well, that won't do at all now, will it?\pIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.\pThat way, we could make some {POKEBLOCK}S\ntogether using the BERRY BLENDER.$
If I had some BERRIES left over,\nI'd gladly give you one…\pBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nWe'll have to do this another time.$
But your {POKEBLOCK} CASE is full.\pYou should use some {POKEBLOCK}S before\nyou come see me again.$
But you don't have a {POKEBLOCK} CASE.\pYou should get a {POKEBLOCK} CASE and then\ncome see me.$
Let's get blending already!$
I wonder what kind of {POKEBLOCK} I'll get?\nThis is so exciting!$
Hi, there! Did you want to blend some\n{POKEBLOCK}S with us?$
Okay!$
That's too bad…\pBut we'll always be around whenever\nyou get the urge to blend!$
Of course, you do know how to\nblend {POKEBLOCK}S, don't you?$
Let's get started, then!\pLet's BERRY BLENDER!$
Okay!\nLet me explain it to you!\pWhen the spinning BLENDER's arrow\nreaches your marker, just press\lthe A Button.\pThat's all it takes.\nPretty easy, don't you think?$
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYou don't have any BERRIES.\pYou can't make any {POKEBLOCK}S without\nBERRIES…\pWe'll always be around whenever you\nget hold of some BERRIES to blend.$
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYour {POKEBLOCK} CASE is full.\pYou should use some {POKEBLOCK}S and\nthen come back.$
Oh, but wait a second here…\nYou don't have a {POKEBLOCK} CASE.\pYou should get a {POKEBLOCK} CASE and\nthen come back.$
Oh, hello! Did you want to make some\n{POKEBLOCK}S with our little group?$
Oh, dear!$
Oh, dear me…\pYou've left us in shock!$
Naturally, you know how to make\n{POKEBLOCK}S, don't you?$
Okay, dear!\nLet's get started!\pLet's BERRY BLENDER!$
Oh, dear!\pThen, I'll explain it to you nicely.\pWhen the BLENDER's arrow spins to\nyour marker, press the A Button.\pThat's all it takes.\nIsn't it simple?$
You don't have any BERRIES,\ndo you?\pIf you don't have any BERRIES,\nyou can't make any {POKEBLOCK}S.\pWe'll always be making {POKEBLOCK}S here,\nso let's make some together when\lyou get a BERRY or two.$
Your {POKEBLOCK} CASE is full,\nit looks like.\pYou should use some {POKEBLOCK}S up\nand then come back.$
You haven't gotten a {POKEBLOCK} CASE\nyet, it looks like.\pYou need to get a {POKEBLOCK} CASE before\nyou come back.$
Okay! Today's going to be the day that\nI set a new BLENDER speed record!$
Oh, dear!\nYou look as if you're good at blending.\lWould you like to join us?$
I'm going to make delicious {POKEBLOCK}S\nand make my POKéMON cuter.$
{POKEBLOCK}S will be made with your friends \nfrom BERRIES in the BERRY BLENDER.\pIs it okay to save the game before\nlinking with your friends?$
Searching for your friends…\n… … B Button: Cancel$
{STR_VAR_1} arrived.$
{STR_VAR_1} and {STR_VAR_2} arrived.$
{STR_VAR_1}, {STR_VAR_2}, and\n{STR_VAR_3} arrived.$
You have no BERRIES.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.$
Your {POKEBLOCK} CASE is full.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.$
You don't have a {POKEBLOCK} CASE.\nThe BERRY BLENDER can't be used.$
I love making {POKEBLOCK}S.\pI always have some BERRIES with me.$
If you'd like, we could make some\n{POKEBLOCK}S together using the\lBERRY BLENDER.$
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\pWell, that won't do at all now, will it?\pIf you don't mind leftovers, you can\nhave one of my BERRIES.$
We'll use it to make {POKEBLOCK}S together\nusing the BERRY BLENDER.$
Oh?\nYou don't have any BERRIES?\pIf I had some left over, I'd gladly\ngive you one…\pBut, I don't have any to spare today.\nSorry about that.$
Would you like to exit the SAFARI\nZONE right now?$
Ding-dong! Time's up!\nYour SAFARI Game is over.$
You've run out of SAFARI BALLS.\nYour SAFARI Game is over.$
Would you like to place a {POKEBLOCK}\non the {POKEBLOCK} FEEDER?$
The {STR_VAR_1} you left\nbefore is still here.$
The {STR_VAR_1} was placed\non the {POKEBLOCK} FEEDER.$
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\pHere, you may witness many kinds of\nPOKéMON rarely seen in HOENN.\pAnd, you'll see them in their wild,\nuntamed state in natural habitats.\pWhat's more, we've thrown open the\ngates to POKéMON TRAINERS.\pYou're encouraged to catch POKéMON\nfor keeps!\pCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!$
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\nIs it your first time here?$
Come in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!$
When you enter the SAFARI ZONE, you\nstart with 30 SAFARI BALLS for\lcatching POKéMON.\pThe SAFARI Game is over when you run\nout of SAFARI BALLS, or when you've\lwalked 500 steps.\pCome in and enjoy the SAFARI ZONE!$
Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\pAll you can catch for just ¥500!\nWould you like to play a SAFARI Game?$
Okay.\nPlease play another time!$
You don't have enough money.\nSorry.$
That will be ¥500, please.$
Here are your SAFARI BALLS.$
{PLAYER} received 30 SAFARI BALLS.$
We'll let you know when your game\nis over.\pSo, until then, enjoy yourself, please!\nOff you go on your wild excursion!$
Excuse me!\nYour PC BOX is full.$

Okay.\pI'll take back your remaining SAFARI\nBALLS.\pThank you for playing.\nWe hope to see you again.$
Good luck!\pIf you need anything, don't hesitate\nto tell me, please!$
Did you know?\pIf you put a {POKEBLOCK} in that square box,\nPOKéMON gather around.$
I want to keep going deeper, but I\nforgot to bring a BIKE.\pSomething tells me that rare POKéMON\nlive in the outlying areas.$
Sometimes, when I toss a {POKEBLOCK} at \nPOKéMON, it gets ignored.\pDo POKéMON have likes and dislikes\nabout what they eat?$
Gasp… Gasp…\nI…made it out here…but…\pI'm exhausted… I don't have the\nenergy to catch POKéMON…$
I'm on a mission to find WATER POKéMON\nyou don't see in HOENN.\pDo you have any idea where the lake is?$
I'm going to catch a lot of rare POKéMON\nhere and trade them with my friends!$
I put a {POKEBLOCK} on the {POKEBLOCK} FEEDER.\nBut it seems to have disappeared.\pI guess POKéMON must have eaten it\nwithout me noticing.$
SAFARI ZONE TRAINER TIP!\pThrow {POKEBLOCK}S at wild POKéMON to make\nthem less likely to flee.$
“Relieve your tired feet.”\nREST HOUSE$
I don't have any {POKEBLOCK}S, but I caught\na good number of POKéMON.\pYou can improve your chances of making\na catch by getting closer to them\lbefore throwing a SAFARI BALL.$
If you use {POKEBLOCK}S, wild POKéMON won't\nbe so quick to run away.\pIt's not much use to give {POKEBLOCK}S to\nPOKéMON that don't flee easily.$
If you put a {POKEBLOCK} on the FEEDER,\nPOKéMON are attracted to it.\pI think POKéMON with the same sort of\nnature are drawn by a certain {POKEBLOCK}.$
This area is still under construction.\nIt's off-limits, sorry!$
The SAFARI ZONE's expansion project\nis finished now.\pWe hope you will enjoy the new area.$
This area is still under construction.\nIt's off-limits, sorry!$
Wow! Whee! I haven't seen any of\nthese POKéMON before!$
The POKéMON in this area are all\nnew to me.\pAnd I'm allowed to catch these rare\nPOKéMON! Too cool!$
The POKéMON around here seem to be\nfrom somewhere other than HOENN.$
I only have a couple SAFARI BALLS left.\pI'm having a hard time trying to\ndecide what I should catch.$
I heard that you can see PIKACHU here.\nWhere might one be?$
Oh, boo!\nI can't seem to catch anything!\pI'll end up wasting the admission\nprice if I don't catch something!$

DAD: Hi, {PLAYER}!\pI just received a very rare BERRY.\nI'd like you to have it.$
If you see BERRIES growing in loamy\nsoil, feel free to take them.\pBut make sure you plant a BERRY in the\nsame spot. That's common courtesy.\pHere, I'll share this with you.$
The way you look, you must be a\nTRAINER, no?\pTRAINERS often make POKéMON hold\nBERRIES.\pIt's up to you whether to grow BERRIES\nor use them.$
I watered the plants every day.\nThey grew lots of flowers.\pAnd they gave me lots of BERRIES, too.\pHere you go!\nYou can have it!$
I'm going to try really hard and make\nBERRIES in different colors.\pI hope you try hard, too!$
I wonder what color BERRIES I'll look\nfor today?$
I love using the BERRY CRUSH machine,\nso I'm collecting BERRIES.\pI'll share one with you, if you'd like.$
You should try the BERRY CRUSH\nmachine with your friends.$
Which BERRY should be planted?\nShould you use or hoard BERRIES?\pIt's fun to think about.$
BERRIES grow by soaking up sunlight.\pWe help the BERRIES grow by watering\nthem regularly.\pIt's an expression of love, isn't it?$
Yes, yes.\nYou understand what I mean.\pYou should take this.$
Oh… But it is important to make your\nown impressions, I guess…\pYou can have this.$
I think that BERRY is rare.\nI hope you raise it with loving care.$
I'll get more BERRIES from\nthe BERRY MASTER.$
When it gets right down to it…\pThe same way suits suit me perfectly,\na crisp breeze suits the sea.\pAnd you, a BERRY suits you to a “T”…\pWhy should that be so?$
When it gets right down to it…\pIt's because you're a TRAINER!$
When it gets right down to it…\pThe way dignified simplicity suits me,\n{POKEBLOCK}S perfectly suit POKéMON.$
You may call me the BERRY MASTER.\pI dream of filling the world with\nbeautiful flowers, so I raise BERRIES\land hand them out to everyone.\pYou're deserving of one!$
Why be stingy?\nTake another!$
Be sure to visit the PRETTY PETAL\nflower shop near RUSTBORO.\pLet flowers fill the world!$
I'm done for today.\nCome again another day.\pLet flowers fill the world!$
The way my husband grows BERRIES,\noh, he's the best in the world.\pHe makes me proud, that he does.\pIncidentally, child, have you heard\na good saying lately?$
Ah! What a remarkable saying!\nInspirational, it is!\pI want you to have this.$

Your name is?\p{PLAYER}{KUN}.\nThat's a nice name.\p{PLAYER}{KUN}, would you like to learn about\nBERRIES?$
BERRIES grow on trees that thrive\nonly in soft, loamy soil.\pIf you take some BERRIES, be sure to\nplant one in the loamy soil again.\pA planted BERRY will soon sprout,\ngrow into a plant, flower beautifully,\lthen grow BERRIES again.\pI want to see the whole wide world\nfilled with beautiful flowers.\lThat's my dream.\pPlease help me, {PLAYER}{KUN}.

Flowers bring so much happiness to\npeople, don't they?$

I'm trying to be like my big sisters.\nI'm growing flowers, too!\pHere you go!\nIt's for you!$
You can plant a BERRY and grow it big,\nor you can make a POKéMON hold it.\pBut now they have a machine that mixes\nup different BERRIES and makes candies\lfor POKéMON.\pI want some candy, too.$
Hi, what's your name?\p… … …  … … …  … … …\nOkay. That's nice!\pMy name is KIRI.\pMy mommy and daddy named me that so\nI would grow healthy and warmhearted.\lThat's what they wished.\pYou can have one of these.$
KIRI will give you this BERRY, too!\nI really like it lots!$
I wonder what kind of wish is included\nin your name.$
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\pIf you're born in springtime, do you like\nthe spring, and if you're born in the\lsummer, do you like the summer?$

Hello, this is {STR_VAR_1}…\pI've grown a little jaded with this\nwhole COOLTRAINER thing…\pEveryone thinks I'm a perfect\nTRAINER, and that makes me try to\llive up to that expectation.\pBut I guess that goes with being\na COOLTRAINER.\pI'll just have to buckle down…\nand grin and bear it.\pYou're the only person that I could\nconfide in like this.\pBut when I see you next,\ndon't worry, I won't whine!$

Hi, {STR_VAR_1} here.\pDid you know that it's easier to\nfloat in the sea than a pool?\pJust by lying still, your body will\nfloat on its own.\pBut if you float for too long,\nwatch that you don't get carried\loff too far out.\p…Where am I, anyway?\nI'd better go!$
Oh, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}, hello!\nThis is {STR_VAR_1}.\lI'm up in the mountains now.\pBut the ground is too bumpy.\nI can't pitch my tent here…\pOh, I had a brilliant idea!\pMaybe I can get my POKéMON to tamp\nthe ground flat here!\pI'm going to try that!\nBye-bye!$

{STR_VAR_1} here.\pIf you cooperate with POKéMON,\none can be comfortable in the wild.\pEveryone should realize that and\ncooperate with POKéMON more.\pThat would be ideal.\nI really think so.\pI think you're on the right track!\nCatch you later!$

This is {STR_VAR_1}!\pI went to DEWFORD's GYM again\nfor training.\pBRAWLY, the GYM LEADER, seems\nto be tougher now.\pSomething about being toughened\nby the wild waves…\pBut he's still as cool as ever.\nThe ladies adore him!\lIt makes me envious, frankly.\pI wonder… Is his friend BRUNO\nthe same way as BRAWLY?\pYou know, all sweaty or smelly,\nand prone to calling people\l“big wave,” that sort of thing.\pBut, hey, this jealousy thing isn't\nvery seemly, is it?\pForget this chat ever happened,\nhow about it?

SCOTT: Hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pI've been hearing about these odd\ngangs being a nuisance.\pTEAM MAGMA and TEAM AQUA,\nI think they were.\pI would think there'd be some\nskilled TRAINERS among them.\p…But if they're thugs…$
SCOTT: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}.\pMight there be tough TRAINERS\nat the bottom of the sea?\pI can't go check for myself.\nI can't swim, for one.\lAnd I don't raise POKéMON…$
SCOTT: Hi, hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pYou know that you can challenge\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE when you've\lcollected all the GYM BADGES?\pWith your talent, becoming the\nCHAMPION isn't a pipe dream.\pBut did you know?\nThere's somewhere even better.\pBut, that's all I'm willing to say\nfor the time being.\pIt's something you can look\nforward to.\pWhen you've won your way through\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE into the HALL\lOF FAME!$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pSCOTT appears to be out of\nthe POKéNAV's service area…$
DAD: In RUSTBORO, there's a man\nthat goes by the odd name of\lthe CUTTER.\pIf you're in the area, you should\npay him a visit.$
DAD: Hm… Little by little, but also\nvery surely, you're getting\ltougher, {PLAYER}.\pThe stronger you get, the farther\nand higher you soar from Mother\land me…\pThis feeling is hard to explain.$
DAD: I see…\nYou've collected four GYM BADGES…\pThere's no avoiding it now.\nWe will battle like I promised.\pCome anytime.\nWe'll all be waiting for you!$
DAD: {PLAYER}! You'd better go visit\nMother every so often.\pI'm going to remain here and\nredouble my training.\pThe way of battling is deep\nand unforgiving!$
DAD: Oh, hi, {PLAYER}!\pWhat's that? MAGMA EMBLEM?\nI don't know what that's about.\pBut with a name like that, it may\nbe somehow linked to a volcano!$
DAD: Hiyah! Haah! Dwah!\p…Oh? {PLAYER}!\pYou caught me right in the middle\nof a POKéMON training session!$
DAD: {PLAYER}!\pWho would've thought you'd become\nthe POKéMON LEAGUE CHAMPION…\pOkay!\nI won't be left behind!$
DAD: Hm? {PLAYER}?\nWhat good timing!\pThis time, I'm going to challenge\nyou to battle.\pI'm waiting in the PETALBURG GYM.\nAccept my challenge anytime!$
DAD: …You amaze me, {PLAYER}.\nHow much higher will you soar?$
STEVEN: Hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pHave you been to MAUVILLE\nalready?\pYou should visit the BIKE SHOP\nand get a MACH BIKE.\pThen, try exploring the GRANITE\nCAVE thoroughly.\pYou may make a new discovery\nthere.$
STEVEN: Hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pI've met a lot of different\nTRAINERS so far.\pBut you're one of a kind.\nYou're not like anyone else.$
STEVEN: Hi, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pWhen you're on an adventure with\nyour POKéMON, what do you think?\pDo you consider them to be strong\npartners?\pDo you think of them as fun\ncompanions?\pDepending on how you think, your\nadventure's significance changes.$
STEVEN: Hello?\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}?\pI'm involved in a spot of trouble\nat the SPACE CENTER.\pI'm sorry, but I can't talk now.\nBye!$
STEVEN: Oh!\n{PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pThere's no need to talk.\nIt's past time for talking.\pYou have to believe in yourself\nand do what's right.$
… … … … … …\pSTEVEN appears not to be getting\nthe call…$
STEVEN: {PLAYER}{STRING 5}… Congratulations\nfor entering the HALL OF FAME.\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\pI hope we can meet again\nsomewhere!$
PROF. BIRCH: Oh, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\nI've already heard about you!\pIt seems your POKéNAV's been\nupgraded with MATCH CALL.\pWell, I should register, too!\pThat way, I'd be able to examine\nyour POKéDEX even while you're\lout in the field.\p… … … … … …$
Registered PROF. BIRCH\nin the POKéNAV.$PROF. BIRCH: When one has both\nthe POKéDEX and POKéNAV, studying\lPOKéMON becomes more fun, eh?$
MR. STONE: Oh? {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pSince you called me, the POKéNAV\nmust be working properly!\pOther people will be registered,\nso try calling them up, too!\pGood! Good!\nYou seem to be quite happy!\pHm…\nHow could I know that?\pIt's because I'm looking down at\nyou from my office window!\pWahahaha!\nSee you again!$
MR. STONE: Oh? {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pWhat's wrong? Have you forgotten\nabout that little errand of mine?\pI need you to deliver my letter\nto STEVEN in DEWFORD.\pAfter that, deliver our parcel to\nCAPT. STERN in SLATEPORT.\pYou remember, don't you?\pNow, since I am a busy PRESIDENT,\nI have to go! Bye-bye!$
MR. STONE: Oh! {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pAh, so you've met STEVEN!\nI'd better reward you, then!\pWhen you visit RUSTBORO again,\ncome see me at my office.\pI'll be waiting for you!$
MR. STONE: Oh! {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pDid you know that DEVON was\ndigging the RUSTURF TUNNEL?\pBut we shut down the operation to\nprotect the POKéMON in the area.\pIt's a no-brainer, really.\pIt's more important to let POKéMON\nlive in peace than worry about our\lown convenience.$
MR. STONE: Hello, hello, {PLAYER}{STRING 5}!\pI heard from someone in PETALBURG\nthat you're NORMAN's child!\pNo wonder you're such a capable\nbeing!$
MR. STONE: What's that?\pYou battled your own father and\ndefeated him?\pThat's astounding!\pI had no idea that I befriended\nsomeone so special! Wahaha!$
Hello!\nThis is DEVON CORPORATI…\lOh, hello, {PLAYER}!\pOur PRESIDENT was here a little\nwhile ago, but he's gone out.\pOur PRESIDENT is busy, but you\nseem to be just as busy, {PLAYER}.$
…Huh? …What's that?\pGROU… Yes? …DON?\pYou're breaking up…\n…can't hear…\pBZZZZ…$
…Huh? …What's that?\pSeaflo… Yes? …Caver…?\pYou're breaking up…\n…can't hear…\pBZZZZ…$
MR. STONE: {PLAYER}{STRING 5}! It's me!\pYou were apparently involved in all\nsorts of things, but I, being busy,\lhaven't a clue exactly what!\pHowever, I urge you to take\nthe road you believe in and walk it.\pI'll always be in your corner!\nTake care!$
MR. STONE: … … … … … …\nIs this maybe {PLAYER}{STRING 5}?\pYour voice is so full of confidence,\nI didn't recognize you right off!\pHm! You must come visit us at DEVON\nsometime!$
PROF. BIRCH: Ah, {PLAYER}{KUN}!\pAre you curious about how your\nPOKéDEX is coming along?$
Hm? Oh, you haven't caught enough\nPOKéMON to make it worthwhile.$
Hmhm…\pSo, you've seen {STR_VAR_1} POKéMON,\nand you've caught {STR_VAR_2} POKéMON…$
Go into grassy areas more and look\nfor POKéMON more carefully.$
I guess you're getting the hang\nof it. But, it gets harder from here.$
Some POKéMON only appear in\ncertain areas.\lYou must be persistent.$
Well, it could use more quantity,\nbut this is looking more like\la POKéDEX now.$
This is coming along pretty good.\nKeep up the effort.$
Are you using any RODS?\nThere are many POKéMON in the sea.$
Instead of just catching POKéMON,\nhow about making them evolve, too?$
This is going to be a fantastic\nPOKéDEX.\lThat's the feeling I'm getting.$
You've collected this many…\nYour talent is remarkable!$
Have you visited the SAFARI ZONE?\pI hear there are some POKéMON that\ncan only be caught there.$
You've finally reached\nthe 100-kind mark.\pThis is an impressive POKéDEX!$
There might be POKéMON that can be\nfound using ROCK SMASH.$
You should get some more POKéMON\nby trading with others.$
I've heard of POKéMON that evolve\nwhen they come to fully love their\lTRAINERS.$
I had no idea that there were so\nmany POKéMON species in the HOENN\lregion.$
On occasion, some POKéMON appear\nin large numbers like outbreaks.\pDon't miss opportunities like\nthose.$
One can get a very good idea about\nthe POKéMON of the HOENN region\lby looking through your POKéDEX.$
I would say you already qualify as\na POKéMON PROFESSOR, and a good\lone, too!$
With a POKéDEX this complete,\nyou're a real professional at this!$
You're very close to completing\nthis POKéDEX.\lI can feel it in my bones!$
Congratulations!\nYour POKéDEX is complete!$
Hmhm…\nOn a nationwide basis…\pYou've seen {STR_VAR_1} POKéMON,\nand you've caught {STR_VAR_2} POKéMON…$

I thought I wasn't too bad, if I may\nsay so, but I guess not… Bleah…$
I got too into fishing.\nI forgot I had to raise my POKéMON…$
Leaving footprints in the sand is\nso fun!$
Waah! I got sand in my runners!\nThey're all gritty!$
I want to leave my footprints in\nthe sand everywhere, but they\ldisappear quickly…$
Should I…\nOr shouldn't I?\pOkay, sure, I will battle!$
I shouldn't have battled…$
If you're faced with a decision and\nyou let someone else choose for you,\lyou will regret it, however things\lturn out.$

You're strong, but should I register\nyou in my POKéNAV?\lMaybe I shouldn't…\pOkay, sure, I will register you!$
Come on, battle with me!$
Ohh…\nI thought I could win…$
I made the decision to battle, so\nI can accept this loss with grace.\pI am still upset about losing!$
Oh, sure, I'll accept your challenge.\nI have a lot of money.$
Why couldn't I win?$
There are some things money can't buy.\nThat's POKéMON…$
Hm?\nAh, you've obtained a POKéNAV.\pI will gladly register you.\nAfter all, I have plenty of money.$
Hm?\nAh, you've obtained a POKéNAV.\pI will gladly register you.\nAfter all, I have plenty of money.$
After I lost to you, I learned a bunch\nof things about POKéMON.$
I lost again?\nWhy couldn't I win?$
I'm fabulously wealthy, but I can't\nseem to win at POKéMON…\pIt's so deep, the world of POKéMON…$
We must have been fated to meet.\nMay I ask you for a battle?$
Oh, my!$
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.$
Hello, we meet again.\pWe seem to be drawn together. Let's\nregister each other in our POKéNAVS.$
We should commemorate how we seem\nto be drawn to each other.\pLet's register each other in our\nPOKéNAVS.$
Hello, we meet again.\nMay I ask you for a battle?$
Oh, my…\nI did the best that I could…$
“Hello” is the beginning of “good-bye.”\nI hope we meet again.$
I fished up a tough-looking POKéMON!\pIt has this magical quality to it!\nIt surely looks tough, yes it does!$
What the…$
Hey, MAGIKARP, you sure don't live up\nto your name, do you?$
There's supposed to be a mystical\nrock around here.\lDo you know anything about it?$
I was thinking too much about that\nrock, while my POKéMON remained weak…$
I can spend hours and hours staring\nat a nice rock without growing bored.$
Whew! I was worried that a kid was\ndrowning when I saw you.\pYou seem to be okay, so what do you\nsay to a battle?$
Glub… Glub…$
If you are drowning, the signal is to\nwave one arm toward the beach.$
Swimming the deep blue sea…\nIt feels the greatest!$
I lost…\nNow I'm feeling blue…$
Why is the sea blue?\pI learned about that at the MUSEUM in\nSLATEPORT, but I forgot.$
My body feels lighter in the water.\nIt's as if I've gotten slimmer!$
I'm floating…$
Your body weight is reduced to just\none tenth in the water.\pThat would make me…\nWhoops! I'm not telling you my weight!$
The blue, blue sky…\nThe vast sea…\lIt's so peaceful…$
I lost while I was lounging!$
I want to be told I'm relaxing to be\nwith. Giggle.$
I'm convinced that the sea keeps\nsecrets from us.$
Yes…\nI am no good at battling…$
I'm sure there are many secrets to be\ndiscovered in the world's seas.\pI mean to find them all!$
Huh? I'm so weak, but you're willing\nto register me in your POKéNAV?$
I've told you that I'm weak…\nAre you sure you want to do this?$
Yes…\nI didn't think I could win.$
I may be weak at battling, but my\ndrive to explore can't be bested.\pI will travel the seas all around\nthe world!$
I'm exhausted from swimming.\nI'm just not used to it.\pI need a battle for a change of pace!$
I lost because I battled at sea.$
Yeah, for me, the sky is a much better\nmatch than the sea.$
Which do you prefer, fishing in the\nsea or a stream?$
Like in deep-sea fishing, I lost\nspectacularly!$
Fishing is the greatest whether it's\nin the sea or a stream.\lYou agree with me, right?$
Fishing's great, but so is battling.\nIf you don't mind, can we meet again?$
I caught a bunch of POKéMON fishing.\nI'll show you an impressive battle!$
I lost again spectacularly!$
Win or lose, POKéMON are the greatest!\nYou agree with me, right?$
What do people do if they need to go\nto a washroom?\pWhat if my ROD hooks a big one while\nI'm in the washroom? I just can't go…$
I lost because I'm trying to not go\nto the washroom…$
Oh, no! I've got this feeling I'll hook\na big one!$
Hahahah! I'm a lousy runner, but in\nthe water you can't catch me!$
I give up!$
I wouldn't lose in a swim race…$
The sea is my backyard. I'm not going\nto take it easy because you're a kid!$
Did you take it easy on me by any\nchance?$
Drifting along with the waves…\nI love it! Why don't you give it a try?$
Yawn…\pI must have drifted off to sleep while\nI was drifting in the waves.$
Ahaha, I lost…\nI'll take a snooze, I think…$
Floating and being rocked by\nthe waves--it's like sleeping in\la plush, comfy bed.$
The sea is like my backyard.\nLet's battle!$
I lost on my home field…\nI'm in shock!$
I swim the seas with a heart full of\ndreams…\pIt's a song!\nAnyways, I'm swimming some more.$
You've shocked me to the bone!\nWell, so you won't forget me…$
Swimming in the big, wide sea,\nmy POKéMON has grown stronger!$
What a shock!\pMy POKéMON has gotten stronger, but\nI stayed weak as a TRAINER!$
What you learn in battle makes you\na stronger TRAINER.\lThe waves taught me that.$
Do you know a little town called\nDEWFORD?$
I hate this!$
A weird saying is getting really\ntrendy at DEWFORD HALL.$
Did you want to battle me?\nSure, I'll go with you!$
I wasn't good enough for you.$
I think you're going to keep getting\nbetter. I'll go for it, too!$

That exhausted me…$
I still have swimming and running left\nto do after this.\pAm I going to be okay?$
My dream is to swim the world's seven\nseas!$
I won't be able to swim the seven seas\nlike this…$
Playing with marine POKéMON is one of\nthe pleasures of swimming!$
Ahoy, there! Are you going out to\nthe ABANDONED SHIP, too?$
I'm sinking!\nGlub… Glub…$
Some people even go inside that\nABANDONED SHIP.$
My liar of a boyfriend told me that\nI look great in a bikini…$
Oh, boo!$
Even if it's a lie, I love being told\nI look great…\lWe girls are so complex…$
I love the sea!\nI forget all my worries when I swim!$
When I lose a battle, I get all\nstressed out!$
Work off your stress by swimming!\nIt's so healthy!$
I love WATER-type POKéMON.\nI love other POKéMON, too!$
Waaah! I lost!\nWaaah! Waaah!$
Shouting is good for me!\nIt uplifts me!$
I love tough TRAINERS, too!\nRegister me in your POKéNAV!$
Win or lose, I love battling at sea!$
Waaah! I lost again!\nWaaah! Waaah!$
If you're faced with a challenge,\ntry shouting at the sea!$
I take huge pride in my POKéMON.\nWe'll show you one speedy battle!$
That wasn't cute at all.$
Since I'm at sea like this, I wouldn't\nmind putting on a pink, frilly swimsuit…$
Hiyah! Look at my chiseled abs!\nThis is what you call “cut”!$
Aiyah!\nFlubbed out!$
Hiyah!\pMy sculpted abs have nothing to do\nwith POKéMON battles!$
Are you properly protected against\nthe sun?$
Ouch, ouch, ouch!$
Cheeks are the most prone to burning!$
I've laid anchor in ports around\nthe world, but SLATEPORT's the best.$
You're the best!$
In the best port was the best\nTRAINER…$
Urrrrppp…\nBattle? With me?$
Urp… Ooooooohhhhhh…\nUrrrrpppp…$
I'm usually stronger than this!\nI'm just seasick as a dog!\pI'm a SAILOR, but…$
I'm thirsty… I could go for a SODA POP\nat the SEASHORE HOUSE…$
Groan…$
I'm getting famished… My inner tube\nlooks like a giant doughnut…$
Will you have another match with me\nwhen I'm not all thirsty?$
I'm hungry, but I've got enough pep in\nme for a battle!$
I lost…\nIt's because I'm hungry…$
When you eat on a beach, everything\nseems to taste a little better.$
Doesn't a beach umbrella look like\na giant flower?$
Mommy!$
If you look at the beach from the sky,\nit looks like a big flower garden!$
Me?\nI'm here every day!$
I'm not losing to you again!\nThat's why I have my inner tube!$
Mommy!$
If I have an inner tube, me and my\nPOKéMON's cuteness goes way up!$
I can't swim without my inner tube,\nbut I won't lose at POKéMON!$
Did I lose because I have an inner\ntube?$
My inner tube is a fashion item.\nI can't be seen without it.$
Hi, big TRAINER.\nWill you battle with me?$
Oh, you're strong.$
How did you get to be so strong?$
Wahahah! This dude's going to catch\nhimself a big one!$
This dude just lost one…$
This dude thinks you're a big one.\nNo, you're a big-one-to-be!$
PAUL: Well, this is a mood-breaker.\pI wish you wouldn't disturb our\nprecious time together.$
PAUL: Well, I give up.$
PAUL: Well, don't tell anyone that\nwe're here.\lThis is just our private world of two!$
PAUL: We're totally, deeply in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON battle\ltogether.$
MEL: We're, like, totally in love.\nOur romance is heating up all of HOENN!$
MEL: We lost, and it's my fault!\nPAUL will hate me!$
MEL: Um, PAUL, are you angry with me?\nPlease don't be angry.$
MEL: We're, like, deeply and truly in love.\nThat's why we make our POKéMON\lbattle together.$
Tadaah! See?\nMy inner tube's round!$
Oh, oh!\nToo bad!$
After I showed you my round inner\ntube, too…$
I can't swim, so I'm pretending\nto swim.$
I thought so!\nI didn't think we could win.$
When I learn how to swim, I think\nmy POKéMON will become tougher.$
For a guy as macho as me, this kind\nof POKéMON is the perfect match!$
I'm cool even in defeat, hey?$
For a guy as macho as me, a port\nis the perfect setting!\pI guess I'll head for SLATEPORT.$
Whoa! Watch it!\nI guess you're not used to BIKE racing.$
Whoa!\nMy brakes failed!$
Flat tires and brake problems can\ncause serious injury!\lInspect your BIKE for problems!$
Yo, you!\nCan you keep up with my speed?$
Crash and burn!$
Speed alone won't let me win at POKéMON.\nI need to reconsider this…$
Don't panic if your BIKE's going fast!$
I shouldn't panic during POKéMON\nbattles…$
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.$
I'll keep chugging on without stressing.\nGive me a shout if you're up to it.$
Aren't you going a little too fast?\nTake it easy and let's battle.$
I didn't panic, but I still lost…$
There's no need to panic or stress.\nTake it easy. There's plenty of time.$
The triathlon is hard in the extreme.\pYou have to complete the three events\nof swimming, cycling, and running.$
POKéMON battles are hard, too!$
I'm exhausted, so I need a break.\nIt's important to get proper rest.$
You know, I like you!\nLet's have a rematch on CYCLING ROAD.$
Isn't it neat to hold a battle while\ncycling?$
Wow…\nHow could you be so strong?$
Were you going after a record?\pI'm sorry if I held you up!$
I've been riding without stopping.\nMy thighs are like rocks!$
I'm worried about muscle cramps…$
Oh, you have some GYM BADGES?\nNo wonder you're so strong!$
I have foreseen your intentions!\nI cannot possibly lose!$
I failed to prophesize my own demise!$
I see your future…\pHmm…\nI see a shining light…$
Ahahahaha!\nI'll dazzle you with my wonders!$
I wondrously lost!$
You managed to win only because it was\na wonder! Yes, a wonder!\lDon't think you can win all the time!$
Could I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?$
I wanted to complete\nmy collection…$
When I see a POKéMON that I don't know,\nmy passion as a collector is ignited!$
I like collecting MATCH CALL\nregistrations, too…$
Hi, have you caught any new POKéMON?\pCould I see your POKéMON?\nJust one look, please?$
Your POKéMON…\nI envy you.$
Oh, I long to make all rare POKéMON\nmine!$
Hey!\nDon't sneak up behind me like that!$
I lost!\nDrat!$
Fishing is all about concentration.\nYou have to focus on the floater.$
Ahahaha! I would go anywhere to show\noff my delightful POKéMON.$
Oh, dear, this won't do.$
Rather than battling, perhaps I should\nshow off my POKéMON at the FAN CLUB.$
That wasn't close to what I could\ndo to show off my POKéMON.\pI'll have you as my captive audience\nas often as possible!$
Ahahahaha! I would be happy to show\noff my POKéMON as often as you like!$
Oh, dear, this won't do.$
I don't think that I could ever stop\nfrom showing off my POKéMON.\pBut I like to battle, too!$
I found some cool POKéMON in the grass\naround here!$
Being cool isn't enough to win…$
It's hard to battle with POKéMON you\njust caught.$
I fell off CYCLING ROAD…\pI'll get over my embarrassment by\nbattling with you!$
Oops!\nI ended up losing!$
Falling… Losing…\nThis is so humiliating for me!$
Okay! Full-throttle time! If you can't\ngroove, you get left behind!$
You got into the groove all right…$
This isn't going to bring me down!\nLosing has made me a better man!$
When cute POKéMON help each other…\nYou won't see a more adorable sight!$
Have you no compassion or pity?$
Okay, okay, you've done the best you\ncould, my pretties.$
Oh, hey! Those GO-GOGGLES suit you.\nBut I think they look better on me.\pLet's decide who they look better on\nwith a battle!$
I couldn't see what was happening at\nmy sides because of the GO-GOGGLES.$
The GO-GOGGLES make it possible to\nget through sandstorms.\lThat makes me happy!$
I'm having a picnic in the desert.\pYou can always find a TRAINER,\nso I can enjoy a battle here, too!$
Ohhh! You're mean!$
When you're battling in a sandstorm,\nwatch out for your POKéMON's HP.\pIt can faint if you don't keep\nan eye on it!$
Wearing these GO-GOGGLES makes me\nfeel like a superhero.\lRight now, nobody can beat me!$
I can't win on spirit alone…$
I'm going to be a real hero one day.\nI'm going to work harder to make me\land my POKéMON stronger.$
I heard there are fossils to be found\nin the desert. Where could they be?$
I came up short…$
If they can find fossils in the desert,\nit must have been a sea before.$
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\lI am to be challenged?$
While I have searched for ruins,\nI've not searched for strong POKéMON.$
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\pNo, wait, was that forty years?\nWhich was it now?$
I haven't been searching for any\ntough POKéMON.\pBut, for some reason, I sure do like\nPOKéNAVS.$
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\pNo, wait, was that forty years?\nAnyway, am I to be challenged?$
I've found no ruins, nor have I found\nany strong POKéMON…$
For thirty years I have searched for\nancient ruins!\pNo, wait, was that forty years\nI've searched?\pHmm… It could even be fifty…\nHow long have I been at this?$
I'm full of pep!\nAnd my POKéMON is peppy, too!$
My POKéMON lost its pep…$
When I see a TRAINER with a lot of pep,\nI can't help looking.$
I don't know where you're going,\nbut would you like to battle?$
Oh, you're disgustingly good!$
I'm thinking that I should go to\nMT. CHIMNEY, but the view around\lhere is very nice, too.$
To train myself, I challenge all\nwhom I meet!$
Uncle! I give up!$
All I can do is keep training until\nI can defeat strong TRAINERS such\las yourself.$
Show me how much you've toughened\nyour POKéMON.$
I see, you've toughened them\nconsiderably.$
POKéMON and TRAINERS learn much\nthrough battling.\pWhat's important is to never give up\neven if you lose.$
There is much to be learned from\nyour training style.\pI request a rematch if it\nbehooves you.$
We're training here to elevate our\ngame to the next level.\lStay and train with us!$
Ooh, you're decent!$
Since you're that strong, you should\naim for the POKéMON LEAGUE.$
Oh, your POKéMON look like serious\nactors.\lI have to ask you for an engagement.$
They didn't just look strong,\nthey are strong!$
I thought I was raising my POKéMON\ndiligently, but, oh no, there is still\lmuch to be done.$
I wish I could become friends with\nmore strong people like you!$
You can make POKéMON stronger or\nweaker depending on the moves you\lteach them.\pWhat kinds of moves do your POKéMON\nknow?$
You've taught them good moves!$
Maybe I should have stopped my\nPOKéMON from evolving until they\llearned better moves…$
I shouldn't have come to a place like\nthis for a picnic!$
Aww!\nI really shouldn't have come!$
In a sandstorm like this, I can't set\nthe places for a picnic even with my\lGO-GOGGLES on…$
How tough are you?\nWe shall expose that secret!$
Oh! Your strength!\nIt is shrouded in mystery!$
This desert hoards mysteries in\nits shifting sands!$
I'll give you some of my sandwich\nif you'll lose.$
Tch! I thought a sandwich would be\nenough of a bribe…$
My SANDSHREW loves eating\nmy sandwiches.$
This is my favorite kind of POKéMON!$
Wait!\nDid you get a good look at my POKéMON?$
When having a battle, I get a kick out\nof showing off my POKéMON.\pI bet everyone feels that way when\nthey enter a battle!$
Show me how to put a little excitement\ninto my life.$
Oh… My…\nThat was too much excitement.$
My pulse is still racing.\nYou're one fabulous TRAINER.$
When you're as famished as I am,\nthere is no room for pity!$
Groan…$
My stomach is grumbling!\nMaybe I can grill some BERRIES…$
Did you come from MAUVILLE?\nThen you should be full of energy!$
Ooh lala!\nThat's a lot to take!$
This road here…\nYou have quite a ways to travel.$
Hahahaha!\nHow about we have a battle?\lYou and me!\lHahahaha!$
I lost!\nHahahaha!$
Hahahahaha! Something flew up my nose!\nHahahaha-hatchoo!$
My legs are solid from pounding up\nand down the mountains.\pThey're not going to buckle easily,\nfriend!$
Ouch! My legs cramped up!$
Try hiking, and I mean really\npounding, on these mountain trails\lwith a heavy pack weighing dozens of\lpounds.\pThat, my friend, will get your body\ninto serious shape.$
Ow, my legs have cramped up.\nCan you grab me some bandages from\lmy backpack?\pNo, that's my POKéNAV!\nOh, fine, I'll register you.$
I've been keeping fit by hiking.\nPower, I have in spades!$
I got trumped in power?$
I hear there are some seriously tough\nTRAINERS on top of MT. CHIMNEY.\pI intend to get up there and give them\na challenge!$
I'm strong.\nI won't cry if I lose.$
Waaaah!$
I'm not crying because I miss my mommy!\nSnivel…$
When you're out on a picnic, why,\nyou simply have to sing!\lCome on, sing with me!$
Oh, you're so strong!$
It doesn't matter if you're good or bad\nat singing or POKéMON.\pIf you have the most fun, you win!$
I caught hot POKéMON in FIERY PATH!\nTake a look!$
What a bumpy ride that was!$
I like the way you battle.\nIt has a certain flair to it.$
Oh, aren't you an adorable TRAINER!\nPlease, I need a romantic battle!\lI'm somewhat decent!$
Oh, how strong you are!\nYou've given me quite a shock!$
Are you busy right now?\nI was thinking that maybe we can have\la rematch right now…\lBut it's all right if you're busy.$
Can you guess why it's so cool\naround here?$
Peeuuw!\nThat stinks!$
The volcanic ash blocks the sun,\nso it doesn't get very warm.\pThat's good for me--I can't stand heat!$
The volcano's eruption is proof that\nthe earth is alive.$
You're some kind of strong!$
Ouch! Owww! I can't see!\nI got ashes in my eyelashes!\pGet it? Ashes and eyelashes?\pOkay, that was bad, sorry…$
I use this parasol to ward off this\nfilthy, yucky volcanic ash from\lmy dear NUMEL.$
Huff, huff…\nI am exhausted…$
You're very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!$
Here, slide under my parasol.\nLet me register you in my POKéNAV.$
Oh, hello, hasn't it been a while?\nMay I invite you to battle?$
Oh, how super!$
You've remained very good at this.\nI must say I'm impressed!$
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!$
With honor I admit defeat!$
I must refine the art of concealment.\nI bid thee farewell.$
Yiiyaah! Witness the ancient ninja\ntechnique of POKéNAV registration!$
From out of the ashes I leap! Hiyah!\nI challenge thee!$
With honor I admit defeat!$
My flawless concealment was let down\nby my immature battle skills…\pI bid thee farewell.$
Thanks for finding me!\nBut we still have to battle!$
I'll use my ninjutsu on you…\n“VOLCANIC ASH SWIRL CLOAK”!\p…What?\nIt's already over?$
You know what's crummy about hiding?\nIt's lonely if no one comes along.$
TORI: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.$
TORI: We lost… It's boring, so I'm going\nto get some more ashes.$
TORI: How much ash do we have?\nEnough for a WHITE FLUTE, I hope.$
TORI: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we didn't, we would lose!$
TIA: Both of us, we collect ashes.\nWe battle POKéMON, too.$
TIA: We couldn't win… It's boring,\nso I'm getting some more ashes.$
TIA: We have a lot of ashes!\nI think enough for a WHITE FLUTE!$
TIA: We want to battle 2-on-2.\nIf we don't, we won't win!$
Pfft, with these wings I can\nflick you away!$
A… What?$
I don't know what to say when I get\nbeaten so easily…$
The warmth here is making me drowsy.\nBattle with me so I can stay awake.$
This is a dream.\nI'm sure of it…$
Losing burns me up…\nI'm just going to sleep right here!\lZzz!$
Were you maybe in the middle\nof gathering volcanic ashes?$
Ehehe.\nWe got beaten cleanly.$
I ought to hide under the ashes, too.$
Y-you want to battle with me?\nEven though I just caught my POKéMON?$
Y-you're all happy to win?\nEven though it's only me?$
Oh, so now you want to say a word to\nthe loser?\pAren't you just the coolest?\nHumph!$
Yodelayhihoo!\p… …\pYou're supposed to shout\n“yodelayhihoo” since it doesn't\lecho here!$
Yodelayhihoo!$
When I was a wee tyke, I believed there\nwas someone copying me and shouting\lback, “Yodelayhihoo.”$
If you're not prepared, you shouldn't\nbe up in the mountains!$
The mountains are unforgiving…$
In the winter, mountains turn deadly\nwith blizzards and avalanches.$
Camping's fun! You can fish, roast\nmarshmallows, and tell spooky stories!\pBut the best of all are the POKéMON\nbattles!$
Way too strong!$
I think it's great that I can go\ncamping with my POKéMON.$
I need to exercise after a meal.\nLet's have a match!$
Oh, no!$
I just had a tasty meal.\nI'm getting drowsy…$
Ufufufufufu…\nWant to battle against my POKéMON?$
M-My POKéMON…$
A big body that's all lumpy and hard,\nenormous horns, and vicious fangs…\pUfufufufu…\nI wish I had a POKéMON like that…$
Don't forget what you've done to me!\nI'll make it so you can't forget!$
Ufufufufufu…\nCome on, battle my POKéMON…$
I feel so lucky getting to see your\nPOKéMON…$
Ufufufufufu…\pWhen I see POKéMON battling, I get all\nshivery and shaky…$
If you're lighting a campfire,\nmake sure you have water handy.$
Thanks for dousing my fire!$
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\pDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.$
You set my spirit on fire.\nLet's register each other!$
Have you learned to keep water handy\nfor campfires?$
I got hosed down before I could\nflare up, I guess.$
You really do have to be careful with\nany sort of fire in a forest.\pDon't ever underestimate the power\nof fire.$
If we were fishing, you wouldn't stand\na chance against me.\lSo, bring on your POKéMON!$
If we were fishing, I would've won…$
I think I'll try my luck at landing\na big one at METEOR FALLS.\pThere has to be something in there.\nI just know it.$
I like to fish. But I also like to\nbattle!\pIf anyone challenges me, I'm there,\neven if I'm fishing.$
I like to battle, but that doesn't\nmean I'm good at it…$
This time I'll do it!\pI always think that, so I can't walk\naway from fishing or POKéMON.$
TYRA: Well, sure.\nI'm in the mood for it.\lI'll teach you a little about POKéMON.$
TYRA: What an amazing battle style!$
TYRA: I was teaching my junior IVY\nabout POKéMON.$
TYRA: Giggle…\nIf you want to battle with us, just one\lPOKéMON isn't enough!$
IVY: Who taught you about POKéMON?$
IVY: What an amazing battle style!$
IVY: I started training POKéMON\nbecause TYRA, my student mentor,\ltaught me!$
IVY: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nI think it must feel lonesome.$
I landed a big one!\nA huge one, I tell you!$
What was that about?\nDid mine lose in size?$
Okay!\nI'll just fish me a bigger one!$
Me!\nI'm not just a pretty face!$
That wasn't cute in the least!$
I don't want a POKéMON that's\njust cute.\pI adore cute ones that have a quirk\nor two!$
Have you made your POKéMON evolve\nvery much?$
Oh, I see.\nThat's good to know.$
Some POKéMON change so much when\nthey evolve, it's startling!$
Hm…\nYou seem rather capable…\lLet me keep you company!$
You're much stronger than\nI'd imagined!$
There is no such thing as a born genius.\nIt all depends on effort!\lThat is what I believe…$
Hmm… A loss this thorough has been\na distant memory.\pIf you would allow it, I wish for\nanother opportunity to do battle.$
Hm… As always, your agility speaks\nfor itself.\lCome, keep me company!$
As strong as ever!$
All it takes is effort!\pI lost because I haven't put in enough\neffort!$
You!\pMy MACHOP!\pDemand a battle!$
Ouch, ouch, ouch!$
My MACHOP crew!\pSo long as they seek power, I will\ngrow strong with them!$
My strongest skill is busting bricks\nwith my forehead!$
Ugwaaaah!\nMy head is busted!$
I've been teaching my POKéMON karate.\pIt looks like they'll get a lot better\nthan me. I'm excited about that.$
You impress me! Give me a rematch\nafter I redo my training!$
After you beat me, we trained hard to\nimprove our skills.\lCome on, give us a rematch!$
Ugwaaah!\nWe lost again!$
My POKéMON will grow stronger!\nI'll redouble my training!$
This beach is my secret training spot!\nDon't come butting in!$
I haven't trained enough!$
The sand acts as a cushion to reduce\nimpact and prevent injury.\lThis is the perfect place to train.$
Okay, fine, you're free to come here.\nIn return, I'd like to battle you again.$
Okay, let's get this battle on!$
I can battle but my POKéMON…$
Even when I lose, I still get some\nenjoyment out of it.\lIt must be that I love POKéMON.$
I have a rare POKéMON!\nWould you like me to show you?$
You…\nYou want my POKéMON, don't you?$
I have this rare POKéMON.\nIt's enough to keep me satisfied.$
I'll battle while I'm running!\nTry to keep up with me!$
Gasp, gasp…$
I made the mistake of trying to battle\nwhile running!\pI should take a run to calm down…$
Take that!\nUltra POKéMON ninja attack!$
Waaah!\nOur strategy failed!$
But my POKéMON were ultra,\nweren't they?$
My POKéMON have black belt-level\nstrength!$
This is too humiliating!$
I rarely meet anyone who's better\nthan me…\pI get it now!\nYou're a GYM LEADER, aren't you?$
Our eyes met!\nThere's no getting away now!$
Gah!\nNot bad!$
Oh, well.\nI think I will TELEPORT home.$
You've disturbed my meditation…\nYou'll be punished for it.$
You've broken my concentration!$
I was meditating with my POKéMON.\nBut this place isn't very peaceful…$
If the tunnel doesn't go through, then\nI'll just go over the top.$
Gasp… Gasp…\nLosing made me tired…$
It's no big deal if there's no tunnel.\nTo a HIKER, mountains are roads!$
My POKéMON rule!\nCheck them out!$
Ouch! A scrape!\nI have to put on a bandage!$
Bandages are signs of toughness!\nI've got another one!$
My BUG POKéMON are tough!\nLet's battle!$
I lost!\nI thought I had you!$
BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.\nSo they get strong quickly, too.$
Let me teach you how strong my\nadorable POKéMON is!$
You're a notch above me…$
POKéMON that possess cuteness and\npower, that's ideal, I think.$
We learn all sorts of things at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\pI want to test things out for real!$
I slacked off in school…\nThat's why I lost.$
I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\lIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.$
I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\pI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?$
I learned at the TRAINER'S SCHOOL\nthat a POKéNAV can register TRAINERS.\pI don't really get what that means,\nso can I just try it?$
I've been studying seriously at the\nTRAINER'S SCHOOL.\lI won't lose like I did last time.$
Hunh?\nI studied diligently.$
I'll have to redo some courses at\nthe TRAINER'S SCHOOL.\lIf I don't, ROXANNE will be steamed.$
I study at school, and I study on\nthe way home, too!$
I'm in shock--I lost?$
Awww, I'll never become an elegant\nTRAINER like ROXANNE this way!$
Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!$
Oh, wow! Isn't that a POKéNAV?\nI have one, too! Please register me!$
I studied a whole lot since I saw you.\nYou must see my achievements!$
I'm in shock.\nI lost again?$
You've beaten ROXANNE?\nI can't beat you, then. Not yet.$
Just so you know, I've never once been\nbested by anyone at anything.$
Oh, my goodness.\nThis is a new experience for me.$
My life of luxury affords me all that\nI could possibly desire.\pHowever, when it comes to POKéMON,\nmy wealth has no meaning.$
When you lay your eyes on my POKéMON's\ngorgeous fur, their beauty will render\lyou helpless!$
Oh, baby, say it isn't so!$
Oh, no, no, no!\nYou've mussed up my POKéMON's fur!\lYou've ruined my hairdo, too!\lI'll have to call my stylist now!$
We'll rock you hard!$
Aiyiyi!\nNo contest at all!$
I should try different POKéMON\ntypes, that's what I ought to do.$
It's a dead end up here.\nI'm bored, so can we battle?$
That was fun even though I lost.$
Want to stay here and keep\nme company?$
Listen, could I get you to battle\nthe POKéMON I'm raising?$
You've raised yours superbly…$
POKéMON isn't all about power.\pPolishing a unique aspect of one's\ncharacter is another way of enjoying\lPOKéMON.$
I'm going to redouble my training.\nWould you come look in on us?$
The POKéMON I've been raising are\nlooking good, just like before.$
You know how to raise them properly.\nYou might have DAY CARE skills…$
Your POKéMON are growing good!\nYou should enter them in CONTESTS.$
Please, allow me to evaluate if you\nhave raised your POKéMON properly.$
Yes, they are growing properly.$
Try raising POKéMON with more\nattention to their character traits.$
I'm glad I met a superb TRAINER in you.\nI hope to see you again.$
Allow me to reevaluate if you have\nraised your POKéMON properly.$
They are growing admirably.$
POKéMON seem to like different kinds\nof {POKEBLOCK}S, depending on their nature.$
I'm in the middle of a triathlon, but,\nwhatever, let's have a battle!$
I ran out of energy!$
I may have blown it…\pI might have dropped to last during\nthat battle…$
POKéMON have to be strong, too?\nI'd like you to train me!$
I'm smack in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut I'm comfortably ahead.\lLet's make this a quick battle!$
I ran out of energy again!$
I was tops in swimming and cycling,\nbut I'm not quite that confident with\lPOKéMON yet.$
I do my triathlon training with POKéMON,\nso I'm pretty confident about my speed.$
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.$
Training is meaningful only if you\nkeep it up regularly.\pOkay! I'll resume my training!\nTomorrow!$
You appear to be training properly…\nIf you'd like, I'll battle you later!$
Are you keeping up with your training?\nI sure am!\lLet me show you the evidence!$
I need to get more practices in,\nI guess.$
I'll resume training tomorrow.\nLet's battle again sometime!$
Once a BUG CATCHER!\nAnd now a BUG MANIAC!\pBut my love for POKéMON remains\nunchanged!$
My ineptitude also remains\nunchanged…$
All I did was follow my heart, and now\nthey call me a BUG MANIAC…\pStill, I am an expert on BUG POKéMON,\nso it's only natural that they call me\la BUG MANIAC.$
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner. I have to do good!$
ANNA: I'm with my pretty junior student\npartner! Let me win!$
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\pI'd say you're second only to us!$
ANNA: We can't take this lying down!\nYou will come back, won't you?$
ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.$
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my super\nsenior student partner and beat you!$
MEG: Oh, no!\nI'm sorry, ANNA! I let you down…$
MEG: I dragged ANNA down…\nIf I didn't, she would have won!$
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\pWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.$
ANNA: I can't keep losing in front of\nmy junior partner, right?$
ANNA: I couldn't get into the groove.$
ANNA: Your POKéMON have some good\ncombinations.\pI'd say you're second only to us!$
ANNA: If you want to battle us,\nbring two POKéMON with you.$
MEG: I'm going to tag up with my\nsenior partner and win this time!$
MEG: Too strong!$
MEG: I battled together with my\nsenior partner, but we lost…\pThat's so discouraging…$
MEG: Do you only have one POKéMON?\nWe can't battle with you, then.\pWe want to have a 2-on-2 battle.$
Isn't it nice? To battle while looking\nat pretty flowers?$
Oh, that's quite impressive!$
It feels wonderful to go for a jog\nwhile looking at flowers.$
Let me demonstrate the power\nhidden within a PSYCHIC POKéMON!$
Astonishing!$
PSYCHIC POKéMON are complex.\nYou should try catching some.$
Concentrate on getting the win.\nThat's how I battle!$
I don't waste any time being angry\nover a loss--I would rather train.$
I think that if you worry about losing,\nyou're more likely to lose.$
The aroma of flowers has a magical\npower. It cleanses us body and soul.$
Oh, dear me.\nI seem to have lost.$
Flowers, POKéMON…\nI love whatever smells nice.\pStinky things…\nI'll pass.$
Sniff… That odor--it's a POKéNAV!\nWe must register each other!$
Were you drawn here by the sweet\naroma?$
The power of aroma…\nIt didn't seem to do much.$
If you use a sweet aroma properly,\nPOKéMON will be attracted by it.$
BIRD POKéMON that FLY elegantly in\nthe sky… They're the best!$
Urgh…\nI crashed…$
You've got great POKéMON.\nI'll have to train mine better.$
Take flight!\nMy BIRD POKéMON!$
They did take flight…$
If they'd get stronger, they'd be able\nto fly more freely…$
I'm a FISHERMAN, but also a TRAINER.\nI'm raising the POKéMON I caught.$
I thought I was doing okay in my\ntraining…$
I couldn't win by training POKéMON\nwhile I fished…\pWas I doing things in half measures?$
For FISHERMEN, equipment is the key.\pBut for TRAINERS, the key ingredients\nare POKéMON and heart, of course!$
I was beaten in heart?$
Come to think of it, fishing is a battle\nbetween a FISHERMAN and a POKéMON.$
Let my melody rock your soul!$
La-lalala…$
An electric guitar doesn't always\nhave to be noisy…\pIt can be strummed to squeeze out\nthis heart-stirring melody…$
When I compose better melodies,\nyou have to come listen, okay?$
A melody from my POKéMON and me…\nLet us deliver it to your soul.$
La-lalala…$
When I play, my emotions should reach\nyou through my electric guitar…$
Go, go, go!\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3!$
Come in, POKéMON! Are you okay?\nPOKéMON 1, 2, and 3?!$
Isn't it cool that I have a POKéMON\nbattle team?\pYou can copy me--I don't mind!$
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nWe MIMIC what you do!$
Whoopsie!\nI lost!$
What's so good about mimicry?\pFufufu…\nYou'll never understand…$
So, we finally meet!\nMy BUG POKéMON will keep you company!$
I wish we'd never met…$
I want to MIMIC you some more.\nCan you hurry up and move?$
If you step forward, we step forward.\pIf you turn right, we turn, too…$
But if you win, I lose…$
I can't MIMIC you winning the match.\nThat's just impossible…\lIt's burning me up…$
Yep, you've finally caught me!\nOr were you trying to avoid me?$
Whoop, that was a great match!$
We're the MIMIC CIRCLE!\nI hope you enjoyed our performance.$
You don't know who I am, do you?\pBut, I also don't know you.\nSo, we'll battle!$
You're pretty strong!$
Until you go away somewhere, we'll\nkeep on mimicking your every move.$
The MIMIC CIRCLE was formed by people\nwho like to MIMIC.\pA battle starts the instant we meet!$
I give up!$
Won't you join our MIMIC CIRCLE?$
Who has the knowledge and\nthe technique for survival?\pPOKéMON RANGERS, that's who!$
I didn't have enough POKéMON\nknow-how…$
To break away from civilization and\nawaken the wild spirit within!\pThat's our vision.$
I hope you'll give me a rematch without\nmocking my lack of knowledge.$
I'm going to regain my wild spirit by\nbeing together with POKéMON.$
You've remained strong!$
Believe in your POKéMON.\nBelieve in yourself.\pThe road will reveal itself to you.$
Oh? Look at you.\pFor someone on an adventure,\nyou're traveling awfully light.$
Accidents happen when you're not\nprepared!$
You're traveling light but you have\neverything you need.\pYou're on top of things mentally and\nphysically, too.$
Do you have a POKéNAV?\nIt's a must-have tool for any TRAINER.\pOh, you do have one!\nLet's register each other, then!$
How's your journey with POKéMON\ngoing?$
I'm still missing something…$
In the same way that you, as a TRAINER,\nrely on your POKéMON, your POKéMON\lrely on you.$
The vast sky holds untold promise!\pNothing can compare to the sheer\nexhilaration of flight!$
Down and out!$
My BIRD POKéMON made my dreams of\nflying come true!$
I'll show you the true potential of me\nand my BIRD POKéMON!$
We lacked potential…$
Ever since I was a little kid, I always\nadmired BIRD POKéMON…$
To lurk in shadows, and live in\ndarkness… That is my destiny.\pI emerge to challenge you!$
I admit defeat!$
Those defeated in battle withdraw\nquietly back into the shadows.\lThat, too, is destiny…$
If you're not on your guard,\nyou're in for some pain!$
You're surprisingly good!$
My surprise attack ended in\nfailure…$
To hide a tree, use a forest!$
I bow to your superiority.$
To hide a tree, use a forest!\nTo hide a POKéMON, use a POKéMON!\pThere is no deep, hidden meaning\nto that.$
You spoke to me…\nSo you want to challenge me!\pSure! I'll try out the POKéMON I caught\nwhile SURFING!$
I don't have a clue about what it\ntakes to win.$
Go for a SURF on my POKéMON…\pThen fish off its back…\pIt's an indescribably luxuriant moment!$
Hit me with a power chord!\nVictory is mine!\lIt's our time to shine, whoa, yeah!$
You showed me who's the boss!\nWe'll have to take the loss, oh, no!$
Hit me with another power chord!\nLeave me alone!\lYour win you have to atone!$
Hohoho!\nI like kid TRAINERS!\lLet's have a good one!$
You're pretty amazing!\nHohoho!$
Hohoho!\nI'll try emulating the pep of kid\lTRAINERS like you!$
Wherever and whenever I may be,\nI always have my parasol in hand.$
Oh, but…\nThat's not fair.$
You're asking if my parasol is heavy?\nYour BAG is filled with more junk than\lI ever carry around.$
Do you have any moves that can strike\na flying POKéMON?$
You soared above me!$
The move FLY is convenient,\ndon't you think?\pWhile the POKéMON is flying,\nalmost no moves can strike it.$
My POKéMON is strong!\nHow about yours?$
Your POKéMON were stronger…$
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.$
You can be counted on to get better.\nI'd like to register you in my POKéNAV!$
A POKéMON that grows steadily is one\nyou can count on.$
Your POKéMON are seriously strong.$
My POKéMON are growing stronger.\nI have to grow stronger, too.$
I'll check your POKéMON and see if\nthey're fit for the outdoors.$
With POKéMON that strong, you're in\nno danger of needing rescue!$
To travel wherever your heart desires\nwith POKéMON…\lThat's the joy of being a TRAINER.$
How's your physical fitness?\nIf you're not fit, you could have a\lrough time in critical situations.$
I'm totally fit, but…$
Fitness training is in my routine.\nI always run with my POKéMON.$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\lWant to battle?$
Lost it…$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\lI'll try harder…$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\lDo you have a POKéNAV…?$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\lWant to battle again?$
… … … … … …\nI lost again…$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …\lI'll try harder…\lFor my precious BUG POKéMON…$
POKéMON have many special abilities.\nIf you want to become a first-class\lTRAINER, learn about them.$
You're obviously thinking.$
The special abilities of POKéMON\nwill make battle styles change.$
Who might you be?\pAre you perhaps searching for ancient\nruins that are rumored to possibly\lexist according to legend?$
What a disgraceful setback…$
That giant rock… I would like to\nbelieve it may indeed contain ancient\lruins. But I see no entrance.$
Why am I carrying this parasol?\pI'll tell you if you can win against me.$
A parasol can't ward off POKéMON\nattacks…$
I don't think strong sunlight is good\nfor my POKéMON.\lSo I shield them with my parasol.$
Me, POKéMON, and my parasol…\pIf any one of them is missing,\nthe picture of beauty will be ruined.$
You've completely ruined my beauty…$
A parasol wouldn't suit you at all.\pWhy, something like this would only\nget in your way.$
I will adopt the movements of POKéMON\nand create new ninja techniques.$
The creation of new ninja techniques\nis but a distant dream…$
Perhaps I ought to apprentice under\na ninja sensei.$
We ninja conceal ourselves under our\ncamouflage cloaks.\lI bet you didn't know where I was!$
I lost!\nI should camouflage my shame!$
Our camouflage cloaks are all\nhandmade.$
If you don't pay attention,\nyou could get hurt!$
Ouch!\nI was the one to get hurt.$
I wonder… Should I evolve my POKéMON?\nThey're cute the way they are, though.$
Your party POKéMON…\nDo you have different types?$
I've seen your policy in action!$
I think it's awesome you're so strong\nbattling with your favorite POKéMON.$
Will you play with my delightfully\npretty POKéMON?$
This isn't what I meant!$
I'm going to a CONTEST in LILYCOVE.\pMy POKéMON should have no problem\nsweeping the MASTER CLASS.$
With my POKéMON, I have traveled\nto the world's four corners.\pYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.$
Ah, well played.$
I would like to circle the globe once\nagain with my POKéMON.$
Your POKéMON prowess is remarkable.\nAllow me to register you as a memento.$
With my POKéMON, I have traveled\nto the world's four corners.\pYou might say I have some confidence\nin my abilities.$
Ah, well played.$
Your POKéMON and you…\pYour prowess together will be\nconsidered strong, even overseas.$
There are powers beyond our\nunderstanding in the world…$
I have lost…$
MT. PYRE…\nThere is a mysterious power\lat work there…$
KATE: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!$
KATE: I blew it in front of my junior\nstudent partner…$
KATE: When someone's relying on me,\nI get this urge to look cool in front\lof them…$
KATE: If you've only got one POKéMON,\nwe can't battle with you.\pThat would be bullying.$
JOY: Together, we're fearless!\nWe'll demonstrate how tough we are!$
JOY: Please forgive me, KATE!$
JOY: Ehehe, I'll have to train with KATE,\nmy senior student partner, again.$
JOY: You need at least two POKéMON\nif you're going to challenge us!$
Stop! Have a good look at my precious\nPOKéMON!$
Oh, how dare you!\nDon't take it so seriously!$
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.$
I took it easy on you this time!\nIt won't be that way the next time!$
My precious POKéMON grew!\nHave a good look!$
Oh, how dare you!\nYou still won't take it easy!$
Maybe I'll go catch more POKéMON at\nthe SAFARI.$
I have this routine.\nDefeat five TRAINERS a day.\lGuess what? You're number five!$
No!\nYou're horrid!$
I didn't expect to lose this easily…\nI'll win next time!$
That was total humiliation!\nI won't forget you…\lHand over your POKéNAV!$
I have this new routine.\nDefeat ten TRAINERS a day.\lGuess what? You're number ten!$
Wait! That's nasty!\nI demand a rematch!$
An opponent I just can't beat…\nSnivel…\lI can't believe this is happening…$
Can't you see that I have all this\nstuff with me?\pDespite that, you still insist that\nwe battle?$
Of course I lost!\nI'm holding stuff in both hands!$
I bought too much stuff at\nthe LILYCOVE DEPT. STORE.\pIt's up the road from here.\nI wish I had a BAG like yours.$
There's nothing I love more than\nchecking out other people's POKéMON!$
Super awesome!$
They're great, your POKéMON!\nHow do you raise them?$
I want everybody to see the POKéMON\nI've raised!$
Wow!\nSpectacular!$
I raise every POKéMON with the same\nlove and care--I don't pick favorites.$
My POKéMON have never tasted defeat!\nOn their next win, I'm entering them\lin CONTESTS.$
Oh, now what happened here?$
I may have to train my gang some more\nbefore entering any CONTEST.$
Want to determine how strong you are?\nI'll be the test!$
You passed with flying colors!$
To best even me…\nYour strength is marvelous!$
You seem to have a big collection\nof GYM BADGES.\pLet me see if you're actually worthy of\nthose BADGES!$
Oh, you're worthy, all right!$
You did your BADGES proud in that\nmatch!$
They say that good times are filled\nwith good aromas.$
Oh…\nI smell the bitter scent of misery…$
The BERRY MASTER's garden is filled\nwith uplifting fragrances.$
Being a psychic is about willpower.\pI've willed myself not to lose to\nanyone. That makes me strong!$
I feel sad…$
Being a psychic is about willpower.\nI thought I wouldn't lose to you…$
I sense it!\nYou and I shall battle again!\lI can't tell if I'll win, though…\pLet's see your POKéNAV.$
I've convinced myself that I won't\nlose anymore. That makes me strong!$
I feel sad…$
I should train at MT. PYRE…\nI'll never beat you this way…$
Don't be too happy if your POKéMON\ndevelop psychic powers.\pYou need to refine those powers to\nmake them really useful.$
Overwhelmed!$
We all have psychic powers.\nWe've just forgotten how to use them.$
I would like to face you again.\nIs that okay with you?$
Have you awoken the psychic powers\nwithin you?$
Astounding!$
Your power with POKéMON…\nThat could be a psychic power, too.$
MIU: Hello, TRAINER. I hope your\nPOKéMON won't cry when they lose.$
MIU: Uh-oh, we lost.$
MIU: TRAINER, your POKéMON are\nstrong because you are friends.$
MIU: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.$
YUKI: Okay!\nWe're beating the TRAINER's POKéMON!$
YUKI: Uh-oh, we lost.$
YUKI: Why are you so strong?\nWe've never lost before.$
YUKI: It's no fun to battle if you\ndon't have two POKéMON.$
MT. PYRE…\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep…\lWill your POKéMON sleep?$
Overflowing with vitality…$
MT. PYRE…\nWhere the spirits of POKéMON sleep…\pIt must overflow with a power that\nsoothes spirits…$
I'll turn your lights out while\nI rip through this tune!$
Hey, hold it!\nI was still playing the intro!$
You're rock steady.\nI'd like to write a tune about you.$
The next time, lend your ears to\nthe full tune, will you?$
Today's the day I'm going to do it!\nI'll turn out your lights before\lI finish singing my song!$
Hey, hold it!\nI haven't even hit the chorus!$
I thought you'd be so enthralled\nby my tune, you'd lose.$
This is my awesome BUG POKéMON!\nMy big brother got it for me.$
Waaaah!\nYou meanie!$
Don't tell my brother I lost.\nYou have to keep it a secret!$
My confidence will get a boost by\nbeating someone obviously strong!$
There goes my confidence…$
They say that you can't judge a person\nby their appearance.\pBut often, their looks don't lie…$
Hello, child!\nCan you spare some time?$
Ah, a mighty capable child!\nLet me contribute to your allowance.$
Contribute to your allowance?\nWasn't the prize money enough?$
I have to tell you, BIRD POKéMON\nare my obsession!\pBirds are cool!\nThey're the best!$
Even in defeat, BIRD POKéMON are cool!$
I gather BIRD POKéMON feathers that\nscatter during battles.\pI'm going to make a hat with\nBIRD POKéMON feathers.$
When there are no TRAINERS around,\nI let my POKéMON battle each other.\lI watch them.$
I kind of like your POKéMON.$
Hehe, I'm swiping your battling ideas!\nI think they'll make me better.$
I lay in ambush, and a TRAINER has\nlanded in my trap!$
If you don't lose, how am I supposed\nto have fun playing ninja?$
I'm going to ambush a weaker-looking\nTRAINER next time.$
I just bought this parasol.\nMy cuteness should be up by a third!$
You're better than me by about\nfive times!$
Using accessories effectively is\nthe secret behind fashion appeal.$
Hey, are you lost at sea?\pIf you can beat my POKéMON,\nI can serve as your pilot.$
I lost my bearings in battle!$
Many people lose their bearings at sea.\pIf you're that sort, you should refer\nto the POKéNAV's MAP.$
Hm! You're riding a POKéMON instead\nof swimming yourself…\pI am envious!$
Oh!\nI can't…$
I'm getting chilled…\nI've been in the water too long…\pI wish I could ride a POKéMON like you…$
If you just float in the sea like\nthis, POKéMON come around to play.$
Oh, darn.\nI've gone and lost.$
While swimming, I noticed that some\nPOKéMON attack, and some just watch.\pI guess POKéMON have personalities\nof their own.$
It's only on a whim, but maybe I'll get\nyou to register me in your POKéNAV.$
If you just float in the sea like this,\nTRAINERS challenge you!$
That's strange…\nI lost again…$
This has nothing to do with anything,\nbut maybe I'll visit the TRICK HOUSE.$
I'm growing bored of swimming…\nHow about a battle?$
I had no idea that you were\nthis strong!$
All the effort you put in must have\nmade you this strong.$
Fufufufu… I dive deep underwater\nto go deep under cover.\lPlumbing the depths is where I excel!$
Glub, glub, glub…\nI'm sinking…$
I have it on good authority that\nthere's a DIVE spot around here.\pIt gives me the urge to go deep\nagain…$
LILA: Sigh…\pHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\pLet's battle so I won't have to dwell\non that!$
LILA: ROY! It's your fault we lost!\nYou're in for it later!$
LILA: Sigh…\pIf only it wasn't my little brother\nnext to me, but a nice boyfriend…$
LILA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have two POKéMON.$
ROY: My big sister is tough at POKéMON!\pDon't cry when you lose!$
ROY: Uh-oh…\nMy big sister will chew me out…$
ROY: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\pThat's why she doesn't have a\nboyfriend.$
ROY: Will you battle with us again?\nBut take it easy next time, okay?$
ROY: Did you want to battle us?\nBring two POKéMON, then.$
LILA: Sigh…\pHere I am in the sea, but who's with me?\nMy little brother!\pOh, hi, it's been a while. Let's battle\nso I won't have to dwell on things!$
LILA: ROY!\nIt's your fault we lost again!\pWe're having a training session later!$
LILA: Sigh…\pIf I had a nice boyfriend, we'd beat\nanyone with lovely combinations…$
LILA: You're planning to battle us?\nNot unless you have two POKéMON.$
ROY: If we lose, I'll catch heck.\nI'm going to go totally all out!$
ROY: Uh-oh…\nMy big sister will chew me out again.$
ROY: My big sister is really scary\nwhen she gets angry.\pShe's going to make me train really\nhard with POKéMON later…$
ROY: Did you want to battle us?\nBring two POKéMON, then.$
Here I am swimming by my lonesome\non this wide, beautiful sea.\pThere's no other word for it.\nThis is pathetic!$
I'm feeling blue.\nBlue as the sky…$
I should chat up lady SWIMMERS\nand invite them on a long swim.$
I'm not going to lose to some\nsurfer TRAINER.$
I've only got sweat in my eyes!\nI am not crying!$
You can find pretty colored shards\nof things around here.$
I heard you approaching, so I hung\naround for you!$
I surrender!$
Sound travels faster in water than\nit does through air.$
Hey, there!\nCheck out my sweet POKéMON!$
I floundered…$
I was blown away by HORSEA's charm,\nso I started swimming, too.$
I'm tired of swimming.\nAre you up for a battle with me?$
You're too much!$
Whew…\nWhich way is it to MOSSDEEP CITY?$
How would you like to take on the\nWATER-type POKéMON I raised?$
Lost it…$
Your power… You're the real deal.\nI'm amazed!$
Ahoy! I'm a buff, tough SAILOR!\nI've braved the world's seas!$
Gwrroooar!\nI couldn't win!$
The tide ebbs and flows inside the\nSHOAL CAVE.\pBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Did you know?$
Register me in your POKéNAV,\nand I'll tell you something good.$
It's high time I get my payback\nfrom you! Come on, we're battling!$
I couldn't win!\nI flat out couldn't win!$
The SHOAL CAVE…\pThere are places you can and can't\nget to depending on the rise and fall\lof the tide.\pBy the way, it's about six hours from\nhigh tide to low tide. Don't forget!$
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE. Someone told me.\lAre you going to see him, too?$
KIM: I thought we would win.$
KIM: A funny old man lives in the\nSHOAL CAVE, doesn't he?\pLet's go see him, IRIS!$
KIM: No, no, no! You need two POKéMON,\nor it's just no good!$
IRIS: KIM, can you tell me what we're\nlooking for out here?$
IRIS: Oh, we came sort of close.$
IRIS: KIM, are we really going into\nthe SHOAL CAVE?\lWe'll get all wet.$
IRIS: Oh, we could never, ever do\nanything like a 2-on-1 battle.$
Why would a BIRDKEEPER like me\ncome out to the sea?$
Okay.\nI'll tell you why I'm here.$
I put a message in a bottle and put\nit out to sea.\pI'm sure that a girl SWIMMER will\nfind it!$
Hey! Was it you throwing garbage\ninto the sea?$
Oh, you weren't throwing trash into\nthe sea.$
I found an unsightly bottle bobbing\nin the waves earlier.\pIt angers me that someone would\npollute the sea!$
Swimming is a full-body workout!\nYou will get fit!$
I admit it!\nYou win!$
Thanks to my daily swimming routine…\nLook! Feast your eyes on this physique!$
This towering white mountain of rock\nis SOOTOPOLIS CITY.$
I was done in?$
I can't find the entrance to\nSOOTOPOLIS. Where could it be?$
Ufufufufu!\nI'm a mermaid!$
My fantasy burst as if it were a bubble!\nBlub, blub, blub…$
You thrashed me… I want to\ndisappear in a wave of despair…$
Hello, kiddo!\nWant a battle with me?$
Oh, noooooh!$
I love frolicking with POKéMON in\nthe sea like this!$
Check out this sculpted body!\nI'm more cut than a BLACK BELT!$
Whoops! Too strong!\nNot bad! Not bad at all!$
Losing to you stimulated my senses!\nI'll train myself and POKéMON harder!$
Yep, you're not bad at all!\nI'd like to get to know you more!$
Check out this beautiful body!\nI'm more shapely than a SWIMMER!$
Whoops! Really too strong!\nNot bad! Not bad at all!$
I'm going to train even harder!\nYou're a great motivator!\lYou have to come back again!$
I couldn't even swim last year,\nbut now I'm a decent SWIMMER.\pI think I'm capable of anything now.$
Sheesh, getting greedy didn't do\na thing for me.$
If you practice at something,\nyou will get better at it.\pYou're young--don't be afraid to\ntry all sorts of things!$
If seawater gets up your nose,\ndoesn't it feel terrible?$
Ack! Why, you…\nGlub!$
Ooh, I choked on some water!\nIt's bitter! It's salty!!$
I'm throwing my whole heart\ninto this!$
You had more heart!$
I need to cool down now…\nI think I'll go for a dive.$
I can see it in your face.\nYou want to challenge me.$
Awawawawawa…$
A well-played match leaves me feeling\nrefreshed and serene.$
Do you have a rival whom you just\nhate to lose against?$
Arrrgh!\nI hate losing!$
If you have a rival, don't you get the\nfeeling that you have to keep getting\lbetter?$
Through fishing, I have attained a\nstate of becalmed serenity…\pPlease, allow me to demonstrate…$
Though I have lost, my heart remains\ncalm…$
It matters not that I catch nothing.\nThe line remains in the water…$
Whoops! Don't tell me I snagged\na SURFING POKéMON?$
I can't keep up!$
It'd be a handful if I hooked\nyour tough POKéMON!$
Well, hey! This is a match between\na POKéMON fan and a fishing buff!$
No! My line's all tangled!\nThe party's over!$
My fishing line's doing a dance!\nThe tangle tango! Hahaha, snarl!$
BIRD POKéMON have excellent vision.\nThey spot prey from great heights.$
Whew… I give up.$
There're lots of diving spots in\nthe sea around here.\pYou can spot them easily from the sky\nbecause of their darker color.$
Run in your bare feet.\nThat will toughen up your soles!$
Yowch!\nI got a pebble under a toenail!$
Going barefoot feels great.\nBut your RUNNING SHOES are cool, too.$
This is what I do to people who beat me!\nI hope we can do this again.$
I still run in my bare feet daily.\nMy soles are tough!$
Yowch!\nPebbles dug into my arches!$
Want to go barefoot for a while?\nSo I can try your RUNNING SHOES?$
We should have a slow and methodical\nmatch.$
You didn't give me the chance to\ndo any strategizing.$
When I'm surrounded by the blue sea\nand sky, it feels as if time slows down.$
EVER GRANDE CITY is still a long ways\naway…$
My first victory seems to be far\naway, too…$
My whole life has been about losing,\nbut I will never give up!$
I know I'm not good now, but I think\nI can win eventually.\pPlease register me in your POKéNAV.$
I'm still feeling good. I'll keep on\nswimming to EVER GRANDE CITY.$
I've yet to taste my first victory…$
I'll eventually reach EVER GRANDE CITY\nwhere I can eventually win…$
You have to swim, cycle, and then run\na marathon in a triathlon.\pIt's a grueling race that consists\nof three events.$
A POKéMON battle is grueling, too…$
I have to ride a BIKE next, but…\nI'm about to throw in the towel…$
Well, I may as well make the best\nof this. I'd like a rematch sometime.$
A triathlon is long. But I guess the\nroad to become the POKéMON CHAMPION\lis also a long and grueling one.$
A POKéMON battle really is harsh\nand unforgiving…$
You should give serious thought to\nchallenges on VICTORY ROAD.$
We've been working so hard to mount\na POKéMON LEAGUE challenge…\pWe can't afford to lose now!$
Oh!\nHow could this happen?!$
After all I've done to get here,\nI won't give up after one setback.$
There is no stronger TRAINER than I!$
This can't be!$
There probably is no stronger TRAINER\nthan you!$
I want to visit EVER GRANDE, so I\ncaught myself a POKéMON that knows\lthe move WATERFALL to crest the falls.$
I'm crestfallen!$
Awww, phooey!\pMy POKéMON knows WATERFALL, but\nI don't have the SOOTOPOLIS GYM BADGE!$
You're looking awfully tough.\nI wonder if I can win?$
Ouch!\nI guess it was impossible to win.$
There are tough TRAINERS galore\naround EVER GRANDE.\pDo you think I may be out\nof my league?$
The sunlight seems to be more harsh\nin this area.$
I couldn't see very well because of\nthe sun's glare.$
I should go back soon.\nI need to reapply my sunscreen.$
This is my first triathlon.\nI'm all tense and nervous!$
Wroooaaar!\nI failed to win!$
If I'm all tensed up, I won't be able to\ngive it my all.$
I'm in the middle of a triathlon,\nbut, sure, why don't we battle?$
I was sure I'd win!$
Do you know what's the greatest thing\nabout triathlons?\pTesting the limits of your own\nstrength and endurance against\lMother Nature!$
Say hey, hey!\nLet's get on with it!$
Beat, I'm beaten.\nThat's it, done!$
There's nothing for a loser.\nTime for me to beat it home.$
What's the hurry?\nLet's take it slow and easy.$
Oh, my.\nI wanted to relax a little more…$
Don't you hate making mistakes when\nyou're in a rush?\pThat's why I try to take things\nslowly.$
Surfing isn't as easy as it seems,\nisn't that right?$
Winning sure isn't easy.$
You have your sights on the POKéMON\nLEAGUE? Keep at it!$
What a surprise! I didn't expect to\nsee a TRAINER out in the sea.\pI think we should battle!$
This kid's awfully tough…$
Your eyes have that look of someone\nwho's experienced harsh challenges\land won. It suits you well!$
In the deep blue sea,\nmy shattered blue heart finds\lcomfort among waves.$
Like the vast blue sea,\nthe world of POKéMON spans\ldepths beyond belief.$
The world's children dream\nof one day becoming\lthe POKéMON CHAMPION.$
Floating on the open sea like this…\nIt's peaceful.$
I needed to be a little less peaceful!$
Swimming and battling like this…\nI'm one happy guy…$
The sea is teeming with POKéMON.\nIt's not easy swimming, I tell you.$
POKéMON raised by TRAINERS are\nseriously tough…$
Gasp… Gasp…\nI'm wiped out…\pThe going's easy. It's the leaving\nthat's the hard part.\pWill I have any energy left to make\nthe return trip?$
The sea… The sea… The sea…\nThe sea as far as these eyes can see!\lI'm sick and tired of the sea!$
Bleah!$
Bored I am by the sea, but swim I must.\pI'm a born swimmer!\nThat's what I am.$
Hi, sweetie, wait!\nWe should battle, you and I!$
You're tough in spite of the way\nyou look!$
Did you see a guy over there who whines\nthat he's bored of the sea?\pThat's all talk.\nHe's hopelessly in love with the sea!$
Why do men love bathing suits so much?\pThey all ogle me!$
I'm out of my depth!$
Maybe it's not my bathing suit that\nmakes men look. It must be my beauty!$
RELI: We'll work together as siblings\nto take you on!$
RELI: We couldn't win even though we\nworked together…$
RELI: The people of PACIFIDLOG are\ntogether with the sea and POKéMON from\lthe time they are born.$
RELI: You don't have two POKéMON?\nWe can't enjoy a battle, then.$
IAN: I'm doing my best together with\nmy sis!$
IAN: I did my best with my sis,\nbut we still couldn't win…$
IAN: You know how PACIFIDLOG is\na floating town?\pSo, wherever there is the sea,\nthat's a part of PACIFIDLOG!$
IAN: If you have two POKéMON,\nwe'll take you on!$
If you can beat me, I'll give you some\ngreat information!$
Oh?\nDid I lose?$
There is an odd place nearby.\nThere's a huge tower there.\lWhy don't you go take a look?$
The people of PACIFIDLOG are\na peaceful bunch.\pThey never get angry.\nThat goes for me, too.$
Oops!$
Tch! …Oh, wait.\nI'm not angry. Honestly!\pBut, boy, you're strong!\nHahaha!$
I used to catch colds all the time as\na kid, but I became totally fit after\lI started swimming.$
I crave more power…$
TRAINERS travel the fields and\nmountains, so they must be fit, too.$
I try not to swim where the currents\nare too strong.$
Oh, please, no!$
If I get swept away, I'll lose all my\nsense of place…$
Win or lose, you'll never know until\nyou try!$
Waah!\nI sank in defeat!$
I never battle when I know I'll win.\nI like to battle at the razor's edge of\lvictory and defeat!$
I contemplate POKéMON 24 hours a day.\nHow could you possibly beat me?$
I lose.\nI will concede defeat.$
Urggh…\nYou're a POKéMON fanatic, aren't you?\pYou must contemplate POKéMON 24 hours\na day, don't you?$
I'm always with my husband,\nbut I can win even without him.$
Oh, I guess I wasn't good enough.$
That young man over there looks just\nlike my husband when he was young.\pHe's making me blush!$
Someone's been watching me intently.\nWas it you?$
Wow!\nThat's pretty strong, all right!$
I can't shake this feeling that\nsomeone's watching me.\pI can't concentrate!$
Now where could my wife have gone?\nI'm always with her.\lI wonder if I can win on my own.$
Ah, I see that I couldn't manage\nto win on my own after all.$
My wife must be looking for me.\nI'd best go find her right away.$
I liked training here by myself.\nIt's awful that all these people came!$
Okay! I won't complain about other\npeople being here.$
I suppose I can partner up with that\nold man and challenge that other team.$
Did the currents carry you here, too?\nThis must have been fated.\lLet's battle!$
Strong!\nToo much so!$
It's just my luck that a tough TRAINER\nlike you would drift here…\lI must be cursed…$
I've led a life of woe and misery…\nI've been cast away, and this is where\lI've drifted…$
Another loss…$
A life adrift…\nI don't want it anymore!$
Welcome!\nI've been expecting you!$
No! Please!$
A strong child TRAINER…\nThat's so annoying!$
I want to win like everyone else, but I\nwon't raise POKéMON like everyone else.$
Darn it!\nMy way is still too slack!$
It's way more fun to do things the way\nI want than to be like everybody else.\lI mean, that's obvious!$
I came all the way out here with my\nBIRD POKéMON.$
You…\nYou're stunningly cool!$
I'd like to go back to FORTREE,\nbut I've grown to like this place, too.$
I must have battled thousands\nof times. I've lost count.$
I may have lost thousands of times,\nbut a loss still stings.$
Keep at this, youngster. So you can\nbecome like my husband and me.$
Young people are too happy to go with\nthe flow. They're without direction.$
You have a firm sense of purpose.$
Don't let others lead you astray.\nDon't lose direction as you grow older.$
Even those POKéMON that can swim are\ncarried along by the rapid currents.$
Aiyeeeeh!$
I think POKéMON enjoy the fast-running\ncurrents around these parts.$
My LUVDISC are looking for a fun\nmatch. Will you join us?$
Oopsie!$
There's a collector who's after\nthe SCALES of LUVDISC.$
Okeydokey! That's enough rest, gang!\nIt's time for a match!$
Tuckered out again…$
My BIRD POKéMON get tired quickly after\na long flight…$
You're a POKéMON TRAINER.\nNo need for words. We battle now.$
… … … … … …\n… … … … … …$
It was I who challenged you, and yet\nI lost. I am deeply shamed…$
The savage tide in this area serves to\nmake us stronger than ever.$
I willingly concede defeat.$
We will return for more training at\nMETEOR FALLS.\pIf you'd like, you should go, too.\nIt will definitely toughen you up!$
O-our boat!\nThe tide carried it away!$
Awawawawah!\nPlease, stop! Please!$
If we can't SURF, how are we supposed\nto get home?\pActually, I know a fainted POKéMON\ncan still SURF, but it feels wrong.$
Can your POKéMON dodge our\nlightning-quick attacks?$
I never knew such a technique existed!\nYou've defeated us thoroughly.$
I haven't lost my passion for speed.\nI will try harder.$
My POKéMON can't be taken down\neasily!$
You're kidding!\nExplain how I lost!$
Haha!\nYou won, all right!\pI'll work my way back up by taking on\nTRAINERS I happen to meet!$
Listen, have you seen another SAILOR\naround here?$
Now, that's something!$
Our boat drifted out to sea.\pMy buddy's a timid fellow, so I'm\nworried about him.$
Oh, hello! You were in a POKéMON\nCONTEST, weren't you?\lIt's easy to tell from your POKéMON.\pI'm a reporter. I'm working on a story\non POKéMON CONTESTS.\pIf I may, would you be willing to answer\na few questions?$
Oh, you will?\nThank you.\pBriefly, how would you describe the\nCONTEST you just entered?$
Ah, I see.\nThat's a very edifying comment.\pYou get a good feel for what\nthe CONTEST was like.\pI've got one last question.\pWhen you hear the word “{STR_VAR_2},”\nwhat image do you get?$
I see!\pSo that's how you imagine the concept\nof “{STR_VAR_2}” to be.\pThank you!\nYou've given me some good ideas.\pI think I can write a good story on\nPOKéMON CONTESTS now.\pMaybe, just maybe, this story will even\nmake it to television.\lI hope you'll look forward to it!$
Oh, too bad…\pWell, if you come across a good story,\nplease do share it with me.$
I'll be looking forward to your next\nPOKéMON CONTEST.$
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\pToday, we're going to profile a POKéMON\nbelonging to {STR_VAR_1}.\pNow, this POKéMON boasts a {STR_VAR_3}\nRank in the {STR_VAR_2} Category.$
Introducing {STR_VAR_2} the\n{STR_VAR_1}!\pThe nickname {STR_VAR_2}…\pEven the nickname exudes an air that\nproclaims “{STR_VAR_3}”!$
Anyway, when the TRAINER {STR_VAR_1}\nentered the POKéMON in a CONTEST,\lwe managed to get a few impassioned\lquotes about the trusty partner.$
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n{STR_VAR_1} happily replied with a huge\lgrin, “{STR_VAR_2}!”\pWell, sure, {STR_VAR_1}'s POKéMON came in\nnumber {STR_VAR_3} in the CONTEST.\pThat line perfectly suits {STR_VAR_1}\nright now, I'd say!$
Asked about the CONTEST afterwards,\n{STR_VAR_1} replied with a tinge of\lbitterness, “{STR_VAR_2}.”\pWell, sure, {STR_VAR_1}'s POKéMON came in\nnumber {STR_VAR_3} in the CONTEST.\p{STR_VAR_1}'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!$
Wouldn't you also like to know what\n{STR_VAR_1} imagines {STR_VAR_2} to be?\pYou bet we did!\nSo we asked, of course!\pThe answer is all perfectly condensed:\n“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pThat's what the concept of {STR_VAR_2}\nrepresents to {STR_VAR_1}!$
The last move {STR_VAR_2} used by\nthe {STR_VAR_1} is entirely about\l“{STR_VAR_3}”!$
Bravo, {STR_VAR_1}!\nBravo, {STR_VAR_2}!\pI hope we can count on seeing\n{STR_VAR_1} scale even greater heights!\pThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!$
Introducing the TRAINER's {STR_VAR_1}!$
Hello! You're the TRAINER who just had\na battle, right?\pI'm gathering interviews with TRAINERS\nall over the place.\pMay I get a few words from you about\nyour impressions on battling?$
You will? Really?\nThank you!\lThen, uh…\pHow did things turn out in\nthe BATTLE TOWER today?\pWere you satisfied with the battle?\nOr are you unhappy?$
Oh…\nSorry we disturbed you.\pPlease give us an interview the next\ntime you visit the BATTLE TOWER.$
Well, of course!\pThat unmistakable look of satisfaction\non your face…\pIt's obvious that you've had a great\nbattle.$
Oh, I see…\pWell, it certainly is difficult to make a\nbattle turn out exactly as planned.$
Oh, oh, may I ask one more question?\pIf you were to describe your\nimpressions about this battle with\lone saying, what would it be?$
Oh, that is stunningly cool!\pThat's a great line!\nI hope you'll do great next time, too.\pI hope to see you again!$
Oh, I see…\pStill, being the silent type is also\ncool, isn't it?\pI hope you'll give me the opportunity\nto share your thoughts again!$
I'll be looking forward to your\nnext battle!$
Yeah!\nIt's BRAVO TRAINER time!\pToday, we're going to profile {STR_VAR_1},\nwho took the BATTLE TOWER challenge!\pFor the challenge, {STR_VAR_1} entered\none wicked {STR_VAR_2}.$
The pair set a new record of {STR_VAR_2} wins\nin a row in {STR_VAR_1} competition!\lBravo, TRAINER!$
The twosome finally succumbed to\n{STR_VAR_1} in match number {STR_VAR_2}.\lNice try, TRAINER!\pBut, hey, it's just bad luck to run into\n{STR_VAR_1} so early in the challenge.\pWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the match with {STR_VAR_1}.$
The twosome won it all by defeating\n{STR_VAR_1}'s {STR_VAR_2} thoroughly.\lBravo, TRAINER!\pKnocking off even {STR_VAR_1}…\nIt defies belief! Simply astounding!\pWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non the moment of glory.$
After a string of wins, the pair finally\nsuccumbed to {STR_VAR_1}'s {STR_VAR_2},\ltheir final hurdle.\pNice try, TRAINER!\pStill, you have to give credit.\nYou don't see many famous combinations\llike {STR_VAR_1} and {STR_VAR_2}.\pWe asked the TRAINER for impressions\non battling the celebrity pair.$
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm satisfied!”\pNow isn't that a refreshing reply?\nBravo, TRAINER!\pIsn't it out-and-out awesome to be\nable to battle to full satisfaction?\pI found out exactly how satisfied\nwhen I heard the TRAINER say this:$
This is what the TRAINER had to say:\n“I'm not satisfied…”\pOur TRAINER was obviously a little down\nwhen that was uttered.\pStill, it's not easy to be able to battle\nwith complete satisfaction, am I right?\pAnyway, I found out how dissatisfied\nour TRAINER was when I heard this:$
None$
None$
None$
None$
“{STR_VAR_1}.”$
“{STR_VAR_1}.”\nNow isn't that great?\pIt really expresses {STR_VAR_2}'s joy,\nI'd say.\pThat battle with {STR_VAR_3} at the\nend… It really was what you'd call\l“{STR_VAR_1}”!$
“{STR_VAR_1}.”\nNow isn't that fitting?\pThat battle with {STR_VAR_3} at the\nend… You can't describe it as anything\lelse but “{STR_VAR_1}”!\p{STR_VAR_2}'s disappointment comes across\nloud and clear, I'd say!$
Bravo, {STR_VAR_1}!\nBravo, {STR_VAR_2}!\pI hope we can count on seeing\n{STR_VAR_1} scale even greater heights!\pThat's all the time we have!\nUntil next time, see you!$
Wow!\pIt's plain to see that you lavish your\nlove on your {STR_VAR_1}.\pOkay, it's named {STR_VAR_2}.\pCan I ask you a favor?\pI'm a TV reporter, and I'm running\na survey on POKéMON.\pWould you be willing to answer a few\nsimple questions for me?$
Great! Thank you!\pOkay, here goes.\nI just need quick answers, okay?$
When you first met {STR_VAR_1},\nwhat did you feel?\pHow would you describe your feelings\nat the time?$
Your {STR_VAR_1} is cared for lovingly.\pIf you were to liken it to something\nthat you like, what would it be?$
This question also relates to your\nbeloved {STR_VAR_1}.\pWhat was it about {STR_VAR_1} that\nattracted you?$
Okay, that makes sense.\pThe next question might be a little\non the tough side.\pHere goes…\pWhat do POKéMON mean to you?$
I see!\pHmhm…\pOkay!\nThanks for helping me out.\pIt was fun and enlightening\nchatting with you.\pIt's possible that our interview will\nend up on TV. Tune in and check!\pOkay, that's all.\nBye-bye!$
Oh, okay…\pWell, if you get the urge to tell me\nabout POKéMON, I'll be here!$
I enjoy this job--you get to learn\nabout POKéMON by doing interviews.$
Hi, you seem to be very close to your\n{STR_VAR_1}.\pDo you know what?\nI'm a TV reporter.\pI travel around interviewing people\nabout POKéMON.\pI'm wondering if you'd be willing to tell\nme a little about your {STR_VAR_1}?$
Wow, thank you!\pOkay, then, please tell me anything\nyou'd like about your {STR_VAR_1}.$
Wow…\nThat's an interesting account.\pYou really are tight with {STR_VAR_1},\naren't you?\pI get the feeling that your account\nwill make a great TV story.\pI promise that I'll turn this into\nan entertaining show.\lKeep your eyes out for it.\pOkay, that's all.\nBye-bye!$

We asked {STR_VAR_1}, “When you first\nlaid eyes on your {STR_VAR_2}, what was\lyour initial thought?”\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pYeahah! That's a mighty fine shout!\pDoesn't it bring back memories of those\ndays long gone by?$
We asked {STR_VAR_1}, “If you were to\nliken your {STR_VAR_2} to something,\lit would be…”\p… … … … … … … …\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pWhoah-oh, now that's an original idea!\pYou sure can sense the intensity of\nfeeling the TRAINER has for\l{STR_VAR_2}.$
And let's see…\nWhat was it about that {STR_VAR_2}\lthat so attracted {STR_VAR_1}?\p… … … … … … … …\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pWhoa! Such a spectacular declaration!\pThe TRAINER's love for the {STR_VAR_2}\ncomes across loud and clear!$
Hm? Oh, there's still more.\nLet's check it out!\pLet me see, now…\pWe asked {STR_VAR_1}, “What do POKéMON\nmean to you?”\p… … … … … …\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pBravo!\pThat's the best shout I've had all day!\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”\pIt makes you want to shout it out loud\nagain and again!\pNow that we've had a great shout, it's\ntime to say good-bye until next time!\pSo, let's all have one last shout!\nAll together now…\p“{STR_VAR_3}!”$

Especially that “{STR_VAR_3}” bit!\pI love how “{STR_VAR_3}” is used!$
By the way, and it's not important,\nbut “{STR_VAR_3}” is a great saying.\pI've been using “{STR_VAR_3}” a lot\nin conversations lately.$
If I had to score this letter,\nI'd give it {STR_VAR_3} points.\pNext time, I'll be expecting an even\nbetter letter, {STR_VAR_1}!\pA-whoops, will you look at the time?\nTime to say good-bye until next time!$
Oh?\nDo you perhaps like POKéMON?\pI'm on assignment with the TV network.\pI'm gathering stories on POKéMON and\nTRAINERS that occurred recently.\pIf you don't mind, could you tell me\nsomething about yourself?$
I'm gathering stories on POKéMON and\nTRAINERS that occurred recently.\pIf you don't mind, could you tell me\nsomething about yourself?$

Hmmm…\nI've got a good story for a TV program.\pI'd better write it up in a hurry!$
Hello, it's time for RECENT HAPPENINGS.\pFor POKéMON TRAINERS, every day\nis a storybook tale.\pWhat we want to do is to introduce you\nto some of these POKéMON tales.\pToday, we bring you the story\nof the TRAINER {STR_VAR_1}.\pWhat did {STR_VAR_1} experience recently?\nLet's find out.\pLet's see…$
Wasn't that enlightening?\pThe story gives you a clear idea of what\n{STR_VAR_1} has experienced recently.\lIt's as if we were there as witnesses!$
“{STR_VAR_3}.” That\naccents the tale and gives it depth.$
“{STR_VAR_3}.”\nThat gives the tale a sense of place.\lIt lets us envision the tale's setting.$
The “{STR_VAR_3}”\nsection of the tale is very expressive.$
{STR_VAR_1} has recounted a wonderful\ntale involving POKéMON.\pAnd now {STR_VAR_1}'s tale is indelibly\netched into your soul, too.\pThat's it for today.\nPlease tune in next time.$

MC: We hope you're in good cheer,\n“3 CHEERS FOR {POKEBLOCK}S” is here!\pToday, we examine the {POKEBLOCK} blended\nby {STR_VAR_1} and associates.\pWithout any delay, let me feed it\nto my gourmet POKéMON GULPIN.\p… … … … … …\n… … … … … …$
GULPIN: Gubi! Gubii!\pMC: And the verdict is very {STR_VAR_1}!\nGULPIN says it tastes “{STR_VAR_2}!”\pThank you so much, {STR_VAR_3}!$
{STR_VAR_1}'s blending performance\nleft something to be desired.\pIf this TRAINER could blend better,\nthe {POKEBLOCK} would be much tastier.$
GULPIN: Gubi! Gubii!\pMC: Hmm… It's too {STR_VAR_1}.\nGULPIN says it tastes “{STR_VAR_2}!”\pIt looks like {STR_VAR_3}'s errors\nhurt the blending quality…$
It's too bad that {STR_VAR_1}'s\nleading effort went to waste.\pLet's hope {STR_VAR_2} can turn in\na better showing next time!$

There's going to be a TV special on\n{STR_VAR_1} very soon.\pI hope you catch it!$
TRAINER FAN CLUB\n{STR_VAR_1} SPECIAL!\pThis is a special presentation for\nthe fans of {STR_VAR_1} all over HOENN!\pToday, we ask the question, “What do\npeople think of {STR_VAR_1}?”\pWe posed the question to {STR_VAR_2}\nas the TRAINER representative.\pWe asked, “In one word, how would\nyou describe {STR_VAR_1}?”\pThe reply: “{STR_VAR_3}.”\pKudos to {STR_VAR_2}!\nWhat a perceptive opinion!\p“{STR_VAR_3} {STR_VAR_1}.”\nIt has such a nice ring to it!\p{STR_VAR_2} also scored {STR_VAR_1}'s\nstrength from 0 to 100.$
The score was {STR_VAR_3} points!\nThat is a very high score indeed!\p{STR_VAR_2} must obviously hold\n{STR_VAR_1} in very high esteem.$
The score was {STR_VAR_3} points!\nThat is quite a good score.\p{STR_VAR_2} must consider\n{STR_VAR_1} to be a rival.$
The score was {STR_VAR_3} points!\nThat's a rather weak score.\p{STR_VAR_2} must consider\n{STR_VAR_1} to be a mere sidekick.$
The score was {STR_VAR_3} point(s)!\nThat's a terrible score.\p{STR_VAR_2} must consider\n{STR_VAR_1} to be an underling.$
There you have it, folks!\pI think we all learned something\nnew about {STR_VAR_1}.\pIn closing, I'll leave you with\n{STR_VAR_2}'s words.\p{STR_VAR_3} {STR_VAR_1}!$
And now, it's time for…\nTHE NAME RATER SHOW.\pI tell your POKéMON's fortune from\nthe nickname you've bestowed.\pAdvice is what I have to give, and it is\nhelpful advice that I offer.\pToday, I shall do a reading of\nthe nickname {STR_VAR_3} of {STR_VAR_1}'s\lPOKéMON {STR_VAR_2}.\pHmhm…\pHmm…\nThis nickname is…$
A nickname that hints at talent in many\ndifferent ways.\pI urge this TRAINER to take courage\nand take on many challenges.$
A nickname that perfectly complements\n{STR_VAR_1}, the TRAINER's name.\pIt suggests that you will forge a fine\npartnership with precise timing.$
A nickname fit for a unique individual\nof a POKéMON!\pIf raised properly, this POKéMON's\nuniqueness will bloom excessively!$
A nickname that will nurture the caring\nand compassionate side of POKéMON.\pIf raised properly, this POKéMON will\ncome to exhibit real warmth!$
A very fine nickname that hints at\ngreatness to come.\pI am intrigued about what the future\nholds in store for this POKéMON.$
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON hale and hearty!\pThat POKéMON should remain fit and\nrobust for a long, long time.$
A good nickname that should make the\nPOKéMON very active!\pI should think that this POKéMON will be\na strong performer in battles.$
An appealing nickname that should make\nthe POKéMON very charming!\pI don't doubt that this POKéMON will be\nquite the charmer in POKéMON CONTESTS.$
The nickname {STR_VAR_1} is rooted by\nthe letter “{STR_VAR_3}.”\pThat letter is supported by the first\nletter “{STR_VAR_2},” which gives it a solid sense\lof presence as a nickname.$
The nickname {STR_VAR_1} is very\nshapely in a pleasing manner.\pThe presence of the letters “{STR_VAR_2}” and\n“{STR_VAR_3}”--now that is remarkably good!$
The nickname {STR_VAR_1}--it has a\nsublime, flowing feel to it.\pThe flow from the initial letter “{STR_VAR_2}” to\n“{STR_VAR_3}” is especially wonderful.$
Let's examine other examples of fine\nnicknames, shall we?$
Try this example. Take a part of the\nTRAINER name of {STR_VAR_1}, and end\lup with the fine nickname {STR_VAR_2}{STR_VAR_3}.$
The nickname {STR_VAR_2}{STR_VAR_3} would also work\nquite well.$
The POKéMON's species name of\n{STR_VAR_2} could be used as the basis\lfor making the nickname {STR_VAR_1}{STR_VAR_3}.$
{STR_VAR_1}{STR_VAR_3} would also be an effective\nnickname.$
What should always be avoided is using\nanother POKéMON species name.\pFor instance, avoid taking the name of\n{STR_VAR_2} to make the nickname {STR_VAR_1}{STR_VAR_3}.\lThat is unacceptable.$
I must say that {STR_VAR_1} is quite\na good nickname.\pI hope that the TRAINER will continue\nto treat {STR_VAR_1} with love.\pThat's it for today's show.\nMay we meet again.$

Oh!\nSpeaking of {STR_VAR_1}…\pBIG SIS, I saw the TRAINER with my very\nown eyes!\pBIG SIS: Oh, what did you see?\pBIG BRO: Well, I had to go on a trip to\n{STR_VAR_2}.\pThat's when I happened to come across\n{STR_VAR_1}, who was trying to catch the\lPOKéMON {STR_VAR_3}, but…$
The POKéMON managed to get away!\pIt ended up wasting this many\nPOKé BALLS: {STR_VAR_2}!\pYou should have seen the expression\nof frustration on {STR_VAR_1}'s face when\lthe POKéMON took off!$
But {STR_VAR_1} goofed and made the\nPOKéMON faint!\pIt ended up wasting this many\nPOKé BALLS: {STR_VAR_2}!\pYou should have seen the expression\nof stunned dismay on {STR_VAR_1}'s face\lwhen the POKéMON fainted!$
BIG SIS: Hey, there!\nThat's not nice!\pYou shouldn't be laughing at other\npeople's misfortune!\pOh, poor {STR_VAR_1}.\nWhat a shame!\pBIG BRO: That's true!\nSorry for laughing.$

BIG SIS: {STR_VAR_1} gave the nickname\n{STR_VAR_3} to the {STR_VAR_2}!\pIt sounds like {STR_VAR_3} is getting\ngood, loving care!$
BIG BRO: The TRAINER had to throw this\nmany POKé BALLS to catch it: {STR_VAR_3}!\pIt finally took a single {STR_VAR_2}\nto catch it!$
BIG SIS: If it was that easy to catch,\nit must have been destiny that brought\l{STR_VAR_1} and the {STR_VAR_2} together!$
BIG SIS: Wow! That's so neat!\pBut you know what they say, a POKéMON\nthat takes a lot of effort to catch\learns the love of its TRAINER!$
BIG SIS: {STR_VAR_1}'s {STR_VAR_2} is a\nmemorable POKéMON because it took an\linvaluable MASTER BALL to catch!\pBIG BRO: Wow! That's mega-awesome!\pBIG SIS: {STR_VAR_1} must have really\nwanted that {STR_VAR_2}, for sure!$
BIG BRO: Then to give the nickname\n{STR_VAR_3} to that {STR_VAR_2}…\pYou really get a good idea about\n{STR_VAR_1}'s TRAINER sense.\pBIG SIS: I second that notion!$
If it were me, I'd give that nickname\nto something like this {STR_VAR_3}!\pBIG BRO: Whoa! That could be the start\nof something new!$
{STR_VAR_2} the {STR_VAR_1}?\nDoesn't that sound perfect?\pThe letters and everything--they\nsound just right for the POKéMON\l{STR_VAR_1}!\pBIG BRO: Yeah, true, that!$
As far as I know, no TRAINER has ever\ngiven the nickname {STR_VAR_2} to their\l{STR_VAR_1}!\pBIG BRO: That just goes to show what\ngreat taste the TRAINER has in picking\lnicknames!$
The next time I catch a POKéMON,\nI should give it the name {STR_VAR_2}.\pBIG BRO: Huh? Me, too!\nI'll use the nickname {STR_VAR_2}, too!$
BIG SIS: Oh, no!\nLook at the time!\pWell, gang, this is it for today.\nSee you again next time!\pBIG BRO: Remember, it could be your\nPOKéMON in the spotlight next time!$

INTERVIEWER: The TRAINER bought\n{STR_VAR_3} {STR_VAR_2}S? That's a haul!\pIf I may say so, {STR_VAR_1} must have\nbeen stocking up for a long journey\lto far-off places.\pFor traveling, {STR_VAR_2}S are so\nimportant!$
INTERVIEWER: Speaking of the item\n{STR_VAR_2}, I just bought {STR_VAR_3} of\lthem recently.\pAfter all, {STR_VAR_2}'s a great item!$
INTERVIEWER: {STR_VAR_2}?!\nBut {STR_VAR_3} of them?!\pI didn't think there would be anyone\nbuying that many.\pMy goodness, I can only afford one or\ntwo at a time…$
INTERVIEWER: One time, I bought\na whole lot of the item {STR_VAR_2}.\pBut it turned out to be too many.\nI ended up regretting it…\pSince then, I only buy strictly what\nI absolutely need…\pOops!\pThere's no point talking about me!$
CLERK: {STR_VAR_1} also bought the item\n{STR_VAR_2} in bulk, taking {STR_VAR_3}.\pINTERVIEWER: Oh, that's smart.\n{STR_VAR_2}'s a very good item, too.$
CLERK: And, the TRAINER also bought\n{STR_VAR_3} of the item {STR_VAR_2}.$
CLERK: Plus, it was during a big sale.\nThat's smart shopping.$
INTERVIEWER: Hmm… {STR_VAR_1} sounds like\nquite the shrewd bargain hunter!\pIn total, {STR_VAR_1}'s purchases came to…\p¥{STR_VAR_2}?!\nWhat an amazing sum!\pOops! We're out of time!\nSee you on our next broadcast!$
CLERK: {STR_VAR_1} is a VIP customer,\nno doubt about it.$
Let's interview the clerk to get the\nlowdown.\pHi, how's your business?\pCLERK: Oh, we're doing unbelievable\nbusiness. It's almost overwhelming.\pRecently, a TRAINER named {STR_VAR_1}\nbought the item {STR_VAR_2} in bulk.\pThe TRAINER almost cleared out our\nentire stock of {STR_VAR_2}S.\pI never dreamt that any customer\nwould ever need so many {STR_VAR_2}S.\lIt's just unheard of!\pINTERVIEWER: So that would be like 100\nor 200 sold?\pCLERK: Oh, no, much more than that!\pINTERVIEWER: Oh, my goodness!\n{STR_VAR_1} must be a special shopper!\pCLERK: {STR_VAR_1} is a VIP customer,\nno doubt about it.$
INTERVIEWER: Hmm…\nThat is amazing.\pBut why would the TRAINER need to buy\nso many?\p… …\pThe mystery deepens, but this is all\nthe time we have today.\lSee you on our next broadcast!\pStill, {STR_VAR_1} is certainly an enigma…$
THE WORLD OF MASTERS\pHello, viewers.\pPerhaps you are aware of a TRAINER\nnamed {STR_VAR_1}.\p{STR_VAR_1} is famous as a master at\ncatching POKéMON.\p{STR_VAR_1}'s quest for POKéMON depends\nentirely on a careful search on foot.\pOn one memorable day, the TRAINER\nwalked some {STR_VAR_2} steps.\pThe total number of POKéMON caught\nthat day reached an impressive {STR_VAR_3}!$
That remarkable feat must have been\npossible because of the trust between\lthe TRAINER and {STR_VAR_1}.$
The master caught the day's last\n{STR_VAR_3} near {STR_VAR_2}.\pThat POKéMON apparently enjoys\na special status as a record holder.\pSkilled TRAINERS should be encouraged\nto challenge this fine record.\pThat's all for today.\nPlease tune in next time.$

Spectator: The {STR_VAR_2} was tops in\nboth primary and secondary judging!\pThat {STR_VAR_2} will keep winning!$
Spectator: The {STR_VAR_2} didn't do\nwell in the primary judging, but it\lcleaned up in the secondary judging!\pIt was a miraculous comeback\nfor that {STR_VAR_2}. Yippee!$
Spectator: The {STR_VAR_2} remained\nconsistent throughout both primary\land secondary judging.\p{STR_VAR_3} and the {STR_VAR_2},\nthey're no ordinary combo!$
Spectator: In terms of being {STR_VAR_1},\nthat {STR_VAR_2} was outstanding.\pI hope it makes better appeals\nnext time, though.$
Spectator: When the {STR_VAR_2} got\nnervous, I couldn't stop myself from\lshouting encouragement.\pI'd like to say this to that\n{STR_VAR_2}, “Congratulations!”$
Spectator: That {STR_VAR_2}'s appeal\nstartled even me!\p{STR_VAR_2}, you were awesome!$
Spectator: That {STR_VAR_2}'s combo\nappeal was stunning!\pIt's shaken me to the core!$
Spectator: The winning {STR_VAR_2}'s\nappeal got my heart pounding!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou were cool!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou were beautiful!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou were cute!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou were smart!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou were tough!$
Spectator: The winning {STR_VAR_2}'s\nappeal still has my heart pounding!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou're the last word in cool!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou're the most beautiful!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou're simply the cutest!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou're the smartest among the smart!$
{STR_VAR_2}!\nYou're the toughest of the tough!$
Spectator: Even when the {STR_VAR_2}\ntook a break from making appeals,\lI couldn't take my eyes off it.\pI'm captivated by that {STR_VAR_2}.$
Spectator: When the {STR_VAR_2} was\nstartled by another POKéMON's appeal,\lI was close to tears.\p{STR_VAR_2}, you were resilient!\nWay to go!$
Spectator: Oh…\nThat {STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}!\l{STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}!\l{STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}!\lHow could it be so wonderful?$
MC: Well, there you have it. This place\nis full of the {STR_VAR_1}'s fans!\pI should also mention that another\nPOKéMON, {STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}, \lcaught my eye.\p{STR_VAR_2}'s {STR_VAR_3}…$
It failed to make a single appeal during\nsecondary judging out of nervousness.\pNext time, I would like to see this\n{STR_VAR_1} make even one appeal.$
It came dead last in both primary\nand secondary judging.\pI hope that {STR_VAR_1} will retrain this\n{STR_VAR_2} and erase the shame of\lthis undisputed last-place finish.$
It failed to take advantage of\nthe audience's excitement and make\lan appropriate appeal.\pWe hope {STR_VAR_1} will learn how to get\na feel for the audience and whip their\lexcitement to a fever pitch next time.$
While finishing first in the primary\njudging, its appeals in the secondary\ljudging failed to click.\pIt suffered a humiliating come-from-\nbehind loss.\pI'm sure {STR_VAR_1} is studying how to\nmake more effective appeals now.$
The audience never got excited by its\nappeals during the secondary judging.\pWe hope it will stop worrying about\nother POKéMON and learn to pitch\lits appeals to the audience more.$
It lost to {STR_VAR_1}'s {STR_VAR_2}\nby only a small margin.\pIt must be heartbreaking to come\nso close to victory only to fail.\pI wouldn't be surprised if {STR_VAR_3}\nwere weeping over this outcome.$
It disappointed the JUDGE by\nrepeating the same appeals.\pIt's an unforgivable error in any\nCONTEST, and the POKéMON paid.\p{STR_VAR_1} should feel guilty for\nthis sorry showing.$
{STR_VAR_1} turned in a valiant effort,\nbut…\pIt was all for naught, finishing last.\p{STR_VAR_1} should learn from this loss\nand put the knowledge to good use.$
I'd like to end this program with our\nusual farewell to the winners.\pThis time, it's {STR_VAR_1} and\nthe {STR_VAR_2}!\pMC: Is everyone ready?\nAll together now!\pAudience: {STR_VAR_1}! {STR_VAR_2}!\nCongratulations!\lYou're the CONTEST winner!$

The best way to determine how strong\na TRAINER is…\pWell, the fastest way is to battle.\nAnd so we began our investigation!\p… …\pThat's how we ended up in battle\nwith {PLAYER}.\pIn a dominating performance, we were\nflattened, rolled up, and tossed aside!\p{PLAYER} is ruthlessly strong…\pHere's our impressions after having\nbattled our featured TRAINER.$
The combination of {STR_VAR_1} and\n{STR_VAR_3} was divine!\pThe sight of them--{STR_VAR_1} and\n{STR_VAR_3}--selflessly supporting\leach other in the thick of battle…\pIt was a marvelous sight to behold!\p{STR_VAR_2} was the move the TRAINER\nused last in our battle.\pThe move {STR_VAR_2} is {STR_VAR_1}\nand {STR_VAR_3}'s sign of friendship!$
…I lost confidence in myself as\na result of our encounter.\pWe were beaten before we could launch\na single attack.\lOhhh… Snivel…\pIn spite of that, {PLAYER}'s battles\nare worth seeing.\pI recommend confident TRAINERS to\nchallenge {PLAYER}.$
There's only one thing to be said.\nDon't you dare throw a POKé BALL during\la TRAINER battle!\p{PLAYER} is certainly strong, but has\nno clue about the basic rules.\pTo our TV audience, I have a request.\pIf you see {PLAYER}, please caution\nthe TRAINER!$
{PLAYER} is adept at reading the\nopponent's actions.\pThe timing of item usage was remarkably\neffective!$
Honestly speaking, I thought that\nI might even be pretty good.\pWhile we did end up losing, we did have\na hotly contested battle.\pBut if you're struggling against me,\nyou have a ways to go, {PLAYER}!$
After our battle, we asked {PLAYER} for\na succinct summary.\pThe TRAINER replied, “{STR_VAR_1}.”\p{PLAYER}'s POKéMON {STR_VAR_2} and\n{STR_VAR_3}…\lAnd “{STR_VAR_1}”…\pMmm! That's deep! There's deep\nsignificance behind that quote!\pIt's no surprise--a good TRAINER has\ngood things to say.\pThat's all for today!\nSee you again on our next broadcast!$
